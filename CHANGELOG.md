# Changelog

Every release of Yu'lon, newest first.

<!--
How to add a line: under "## Unreleased" use only the headings "### New", "### Fixed" and "### Changed".
One plain line per change, at most about 120 characters, saying what the player gets. Bold button names are fine;
ticket ids, proof, test notes, numbers as evidence, backticks and commands are not: they go in the pull request.
New: Set a server's time zone on the Tuning tab with **Server time zone**.
Fixed: Sending gold to a character no longer crashes the app.
Changed: Opening Yu'lon while it is already running brings the open window to the front.

## Unreleased

### New

### Fixed
- The update check no longer offers an older build as the newest once a version has a tenth patch release.
- Uninstall now moves your database backups to a folder beside the server folder and says where, instead of deleting them.

### Changed

## v0.9.16-Public — 2026-10-10

### New
- Every game's Modules tab adds a game add-on from a link, a folder or a zip with **Game add-ons you bring**.
- **Play** puts the game add-ons you brought back into a ready-to-play client that was made again.
- The support file now says how big your computer is: processor, memory, and how much of it Docker gets.
- **Auction House Bot** asks you to pick its character from your server's list; the Characters tab shows each GUID.
- A module you add from a link or a folder gets a settings card on the Tuning tab, made from its own settings file.
- A Tortoise server puts its TortoiseBots and GM Manager addons into your game client by itself, until you remove them.
- On Tortoise, **Install from link…** and **Install from folder…** take a client add-on or a set of database changes.
- Database changes added that way are backed up first and run once; **Remove** keeps them and names that backup.
- On Tortoise, a server module can be installed from a link or folder; **Rebuild the server…** builds it in.
- **Pack for another computer…** moves accounts and characters into a server of the same game on another computer.
- **Delete…** and **Clean up…** on the Maintenance tab remove old backups, always keeping the newest good copy of each.
- Addon and module update chips now fill in by themselves once a day, without pressing **Check for updates**.
- **Pack the whole server…** and **Bring from another computer…** rebuild a server, world and modules, on another PC.
- **Pack the whole server…** now carries a module added from a folder; **Bring from another computer…** installs it.

### Fixed
- WotLK and Unbound bot settings work again on the newest bots module: Yu'lon renames them for it, and back.
- A custom SQL fix the database refused now shows on the Server tab, and a fresh install says so at the end.
- TBC and Vanilla servers now get the database's own data corrections, new installs and updates alike.
- WotLK and Unbound offer **Update Docker Compose** when it is too old for them; a cut-off database import is redone.
- After an update stopped mid-build, Start says the build is behind its sources and names **Rebuild the server…**.
- A bot settings file renamed for the newest bots module also gets the settings that module added.
- A small step back of your computer's clock no longer hides the "history was rewritten" line in the update question.
- An install stops before building, naming the folder, when another install already holds its container names.
- Moving a server says "1 account and 0 characters of players, plus 100 bot accounts with 1000 bot characters".
- Bringing a whole server in holds it for the whole job, so another Yu'lon stays refused and no warning shows.
- On Tortoise, a failed update puts the world database back too, and the copy it takes is one a return can use.
- On Windows, opening the LAN ports asks for administrator rights itself, and the commands it shows now work when pasted.
- The Lua engine builds again with the newest Playerbots, which renamed settings the engine still asked for.
- Making the support file no longer takes minutes on big old logs: it keeps their newest lines and says what it cut.
- While the world keeps crashing and restarting, the Server tab says so instead of "The server is already running."
- **Start** on a server whose build is gone says so and names **Rebuild the server…** before starting anything.
- **Rebuild the server…** on a server from the retired playerbots fork says so at once, not after half an hour.
- **Return to the tested pin…** no longer builds onto databases a newer build updated; it names the backup to restore.
- A failed, stopped or rolled-back update keeps every earlier database copy; only a successful one clears them.
- On Tortoise, **Return to the tested pin…** no longer builds onto databases a newer build migrated; it names the backup.
- A module update that breaks the build is still put back when you pressed Stop just as the build failed.
- A new Tortoise login server no longer logs every database statement; older ones get this with **Reset to default**.
- A database password typed inside escaped or joined quotes no longer slips into a support zip.
- Rebuilding or updating a server now swaps in its Lua scripts only after the old server has stopped.
- A Rebuild that fails part-way through laying Lua scripts leaves the old server stopped; Start says to Rebuild.
- On Windows, SQL with accented or non-Latin letters reaches the database exactly as written.
- On Tortoise, a module named like one the server holds is refused, and a refused add-on update is put back.
- On Tortoise, **Remove** of an add-on you added takes back its files, keeping any you changed and your saved settings.
- Restore refuses a backup made on another game, such as WotLK onto Unbound, and asks about an old one.
- Two Yu'lons no longer update or start one server at once: the second says who holds it, and **Stop** asks first.
- Modules, Party links, channel setup and bot rebuilds refuse while another Yu'lon works on the server.
- **Stop** no longer waits long on a slow Docker to reserve the server; it goes ahead after a few seconds.
- Account, character and settings changes refuse while another Yu'lon works on the server, and name who holds it.
- The saved server log leaves out a line the cleaner is unsure of, and the support file says why a log is left out.
- **Save logs for support…** now says how many logs it left out of the zip, and why, before you send it.
- A Tortoise world that fails a database update now stops and names the file and error, instead of hanging.
- The realm badge says UPDATE FAILED, not STARTING, for a Tortoise world stuck at a failed database update.
- An older Tortoise server is offered **Turn it off** for its SQL log spam on the Tuning tab, without a full reset.
- Saving settings no longer freezes the window.
- Network **Apply**, uninstall and the time zone refuse while another Yu'lon works on the server, and name who holds it.
- Starting and stopping the pathfinding data refuse while another Yu'lon works on the server; finishing waits for it.
- On disks with hard links, two Yu'lons pressing on one new folder at once no longer report a false id-file error.

### Changed
- Centurion and TBC servers move to newer builds of their sources; there is nothing new for players to notice.
- WotLK and WoW Unbound are tested on the newest AzerothCore Playerbot core and mod-playerbots, with mod-ale to match.
- Tortoise installs the TortoiseBots of 10 October; bot logs keep 3 days; unchanged bot settings follow its new defaults.
- WoW Unbound is built on the same newer server core as WotLK; **Return to the tested pin…** moves an existing one there.
- NPC Teleporter follows its author's new menu numbers; installing over an older install keeps the base game's menus.
- The Tortoise bot dashboard switches on in seconds from TortoiseBots' ready-made program when one fits your server.
- The update question says copies are kept until an update succeeds, and a restore says how long it takes.

## v0.9.15-Public — 2026-10-09

### New
- **WoW Unbound**, a multi-class WotLK server of its own that runs beside your WotLK one, is in the Catalog.
- WoW Unbound's ready-to-play client gets its three addons, kept in step with the server at every **Play**.
- The Server tab says whether Unbound loaded and which of its switches are on, or what is missing.
- WoW Unbound's Mentor stands in every capital and in Dalaran, and the install checks that all nine are there.
- **Restart** on the Server tab and in the tray menu stops a server, saving every character, and starts it again.
- Closing Yu'lon keeps it in the system tray: see which servers are up, **Start** them or **Play**, from the tray icon.
- Merged changes, new issues and releases now post to the Discord server, each with a short summary.

### Fixed
- Install now refuses a game client of the wrong version before it builds anything, and names the version it needs.
- A Tortoise server that restarts while loading its transports now says the game client's data is the likely cause.
- A new Tortoise server no longer fills its log with every database query; older ones get this with **Reset to defaults**.
- A server left behind when Yu'lon's tested server code moves on is offered **Return to the tested pin…** to catch up.
- A module build that fails because it needs newer server code now says which server press builds it, and in what order.
- My Party reads a hand-edited conf as the server does: indented settings count, the first copy wins.
- The bot counts see an indented setting in a hand-edited conf.
- A server setting file over 1 MB is no longer loaded into the Tuning tab's editor, which could freeze Yu'lon.
- On macOS the Tuning tab no longer lets you edit the server's own conf under a different spelling of its name.
- **Save file** on the Tuning tab keeps the file's line endings and byte-order mark.
- The Tuning tab no longer opens, saves, backs up or reverts a setting file that is a link out of the server folder.
- **Reset to default** and its undo leave a setting file alone when its folder is a link to somewhere outside the server folder.
- **Add to Steam** and self-update no longer mistake another AppImage for Yu'lon when it is started from inside one.
- **Set level** on a character in the world now saves it, so the Characters list shows the new level.
- **My Party** no longer says the Lua engine is switched off when its settings file says true.
- Installing the Lua engine (ALE) now makes the folder for your own Lua scripts, and its row says where it is.
- Stopping a Tortoise server just after it starts now waits for its save, instead of warning that characters may be missing.
- A Tortoise server shows as offline in the realm list while it loads, so logging in no longer bounces back to it with no word.
- An account created with a GM level on a running Tortoise server is GM at once, with no restart.
- While Yu'lon is open, a Tortoise realm shows offline while it reloads after a crash, and not over a running server.
- A new WotLK server with the Lua engine (ALE) builds again: WotLK now installs the AzerothCore and bots of 2 October.

- The **Tuning** tab lists every module config file in the server's modules folder, with a scroll bar when there are many.
- A file of a server's client pack deleted from the ready-to-play client is put back at the next **Play**.
- On Centurion, **Revive** works again after a server update, and pathfinding data no longer crashes while made.
- A world update the database refused can be run again from **Apply database corrections…**, after it asks first.
- A world update whose file is gone can be skipped from **Apply database corrections…**; a renamed one is retried.
- A module update that breaks the build is now put back automatically; **Put back the last update…** undoes one by hand.
- Removing NPC Teleporter on WotLK now takes its teleporters out of the world again.
- Removing NPC Teleporter on WotLK also clears its menus and scripts, and restores the gate menus it replaced.
- Installing NPC Teleporter on WotLK no longer breaks Mountaineer Pebblebitty's and Maggran Earthbinder's menus; Install again to mend.
- Updating a TBC or Vanilla server now brings in its new world content fixes once, and names any it could not apply.
- Updating a TBC or Vanilla server stops before building when the new code needs database changes it cannot apply.
- Updating a TBC or Vanilla server reloads changed bot tables, replacing what the bots had generated in them.
- TBC and Vanilla servers no longer risk a crash when bots fight Netherspite in Karazhan or pick certain mounts.
- Two Yu'lons pressing **Re-extract map data** on one server folder at the same moment: only one goes ahead.
- When another Yu'lon is extracting into the folder, **Re-extract map data** says so and never offers to remove its run.
- Two Yu'lons sharing a server folder, as Windows and WSL or via a link, no longer extract into it once one has started.
- On Windows, **Stop** ends a build's leftover helpers even when the build's own docker process had already exited.
- **Stop** during **Re-extract map data** ends the map extractor at once and puts the old map data back.
- The pathfinding line quotes the generator up to a whole word, and **Refresh** keeps what **Stop** said there.
- **Stop** during a clone or map tool removes its container, even as it starts; one Docker would not start goes too.
- **Re-extract map data** waits for a map tool an earlier Yu'lon left running instead of writing under it.
- A tool container Yu'lon could not remove is named with the command that removes it; host git never clones under one.
- Installing a module never writes into another folder through a link in your game client; it names the link instead.
- On Windows, a link inside the server folder no longer stops a finished build from being kept for the next rebuild.
- **Stop** during a quiet build step ends the build at once, not at its next line.
- **Stop** during a clone with your own git also ends the helpers git started.
- A module whose files hold a link is refused, naming the link, so it never copies files from elsewhere on your computer.
- Adding a module from a folder again keeps the working copy if the new copy fails part way, as the message says.
- **Stop** during a database import ends the importer too; **Install** again never clears databases it still writes.
- **Stop** asks Docker once to end a build, instead of again every tenth of a second until it has.
- **Re-extract map data** stops, and says why, if its reservation of the folder ends part way.
- Install now checks every port the server needs before the build, and says if Windows has reserved the database port.
- A port the server cannot use is said in plain words, and a failed start shows Docker's error first.
- A WotLK game client that is not build 12340 is named and refused, instead of dropping you after the password.
- The support file now also removes login keys and tokens, and your home folder however a log spells it.
- The **A module this app does not ship** box says when a game cannot take your own modules, instead of two dead buttons.

### Changed
- Each WotLK-style server now has its own container names and ports, so a second one can run beside WotLK.
- On Linux, **Stop** during a build is said to end it at once, as it does; the line after a Stop says so on Windows too.
- A stopped install or rebuild says what the Stop left, after **Stopped:**.

## v0.9.14-Public — 2026-10-07

### Fixed
- On Windows with Docker Desktop, a WotLK build no longer fails within a second of starting.
- A Tortoise server installed before the dbc.MPQ check learns that archive on its next Install, so a later swap is noticed.

### Changed
- A WotLK install keeps one copy of the shared server source in Docker's build cache instead of two, saving about 1.5 GB.
- New TBC, Vanilla and Centurion servers build from their projects' newest code of October 2026.
- TBC and Vanilla bots fight Netherspite better, and a Centurion battleground win restores a depleted mark.

## v0.9.13-Public — 2026-10-06

### New
- **Where to get help…** on the Server tab links each game's server, bots and community, and Yu'lon's issues page.
- If Docker lost a server's database, **Start** and **Rebuild** say so and offer **Repair the database…**.
- A Server rates card on the Tuning tab sets XP, gold, item drops, reputation and honor on every game.
- Delete an account from the Accounts tab; all-digit names are refused on TBC, Vanilla and Tortoise.
- Centurion can be installed from the Catalog on Windows and Linux: level-60 PvP WoW on the 3.3.5a client, with bots.
- Each server has its own game launcher: press **▶** on its tab or **Play** to see who is online and press **PLAY**.
- **Make a ready-to-play client…** makes a copy of your client for one server, sharing the big game files to save space.
- A ready-to-play client can carry a server's patches and addons, and optional packs such as HD packs.
- Set a server's time zone on the Tuning tab with **Server time zone**.
- Centurion's **Characters** tab offers **Set level**, **Teleport**, **Send gold**, **Send everything worn** and more.
- Centurion's pathfinding data continues where it stopped instead of starting again from 0 %.
- On a Steam Deck, **Reinstall Docker after a SteamOS update…** brings back the Docker a SteamOS update removed.
- On Linux and the Steam Deck, folder pickers list your SD cards and USB drives.
- WoW TBC, Vanilla and Tortoise servers keep their log files in a logs folder inside the server folder.
- A server left broken by a failed update or rebuild is mended with **Repair server files…**, without a reinstall.
- A finished build that could not be started is kept, and the next rebuild uses it instead of compiling again.

### Fixed
- Tortoise builds TortoiseBots v10, whose faster travel and auction-house planning cuts lag on servers with hundreds of bots.
- A Tortoise client folder missing its dbc.MPQ archive is refused before the build, with how to fix it.
- A missing bots table is now reported once, with how to fix it, instead of a quiet note every few seconds.
- Stopping a Tortoise server with a hired companion online no longer crashes it or asks you to check your characters.
- On Centurion, **Stop** logs players and bots out first and waits while their saves are written, so no change is lost.
- Installing a module that asks a question about your characters starts a stopped database to check the answer.
- A module install refused after Yu'lon started the database to check your answers now says the database is still running.
- Removing **All Stackables to 200** on WotLK puts every item's stack size and limit back exactly as it was.
- **Stop** still ends what it was pressed for when your computer is too short of resources to start a helper.
- On Windows, **Stop** also ends the helper programs a build started on your PC.
- The worldserver log saved when you stop a server has passwords masked, as the support file does.
- A failed install is listed once in the support file, however its folder is spelled.
- After a module install on a stopped server, the report says to press **Start** rather than **Stop** then **Start**.
- Refusing a client folder now reads as two plain sentences instead of one run-on line.
- A module's right-click **Remove** is offered only when the module is installed.
- **Forget Yu'lon's record…** asks in a box that fits small screens and defaults to No.
- The header says STARTING, not REALM ONLINE, until the world server reports ready, including while Docker restarts it.
- A database that is a moment slow to answer after a start no longer logs a warning.
- A brand-new database that is still doing its first setup no longer logs "Access denied", "Can't connect" or a missing-table warning.
- **Refresh** keeps the sentence beside **Repair the database…** and **Restore a backup…** instead of clearing it.
- The corrections dialog names each step by what it does instead of "statement 1".
- After **Stop**, the missing-database sentence stays beside **Repair the database…** and **Restore a backup…**.
- An empty server database now says it is empty, not that Docker's copy was removed.
- **Repair the database…** and the adopt button appear even when the database was still starting at the first look.
- **Restart server…** and **Recreate containers…** say done only once the world is up, and say so plainly if it crash-loops.
- Once a crash loop is fixed, the Server tab reads up a minute after the world says ready, not ten minutes later.
- The header reads CRASH LOOP, not REALM ONLINE, while the world server keeps crashing.
- A rebuild whose rollback did not come up says its containers are still running and to press Stop.
- A long failure under the rebuild log is shown whole at every window size; its last lines were cut off.
- The AH bot's GUID, account and items-per-cycle accept 0 to 4294967295 and refuse a negative number.
- The raw file editor on the Tuning tab warns before saving a whole-number setting the server would read differently.
- A decimal module question, such as the XP rates, takes only the digits 0 to 9 and one point, and refuses "1_0".
- **Save logs for support…** also reads the servers of an install that failed, even though it was never added to the list.
- **Save logs for support…** keeps what database and Tortoise login containers wrote as errors, not only their normal output.
- The main window fits a Steam Deck or a small screen instead of hanging off its edges, and scrolls when it is cramped.
- Long error and warning messages scroll inside their box, so its OK button always stays on screen.
- After a reinstall or a new data folder, **Repair the command channel** gives Yu'lon's own server account a new password.
- After **Repair the database…**, the command channel offers **Repair** for its lost account, or turning on if it is off.
- After the command channel gave up, **Refresh**, **Start** or turning it on checks it again without restarting Yu'lon.
- The **Apply database corrections…** offer appears even when the database was still starting when Yu'lon looked.
- A server shutdown typed on the Console tab is not sent: Docker would start the world again, so it points to **Stop**.
- On Centurion and Tortoise, **Stop** has the world server save every character, bots included, before it closes.
- On Windows, Centurion and Tortoise's **Stop** asks for that save through the command channel and says when it could not.
- **Stop** lets the world server finish saving every character before it closes, even on a slow disk.
- A failed install now shows its servers' last log lines, and **Save logs for support…** keeps them.

- A module that only changes settings, such as Experience Rates, now shows as installed and can be removed.
- Number boxes in Tuning and module questions take only the digits 0 to 9, so the server reads exactly what you typed.
- After you remove Experience Rates, setting its rates back by hand no longer makes it read as installed again.
- Removing a settings module whose file Yu'lon cannot read now says so instead of claiming nothing changes.
- The Server tab no longer says "restart loop" after Docker itself was stopped and started.
- Stop takes effect at once and never kills a loading world, and a clean put-back after Stop reads Stopped.
- On Windows, an Xbox or Xbox-style gamepad now moves around Yu'lon; before, its buttons were not read.
- Long questions such as **Rebuild the server…** scroll inside a dialog that fits the screen; the buttons always show.
- A fresh Centurion server no longer restarts over and over at the end of its install.
- A fresh Centurion server no longer crashes on its first start while it makes its bots.
- On Windows, Centurion no longer stalls at start-up; older installs need **Repair server files…**, then **Recreate containers…**.
- WoW TBC and Vanilla installs and rebuilds work again, with the bots version Yu'lon has tested.
- A Tortoise server no longer crashes after its weekly honor day; older installs press **Apply database corrections…**.
- Stopping a TBC, Vanilla or Tortoise server while its world loads no longer kills it and loses progress.
- A failed **Update the server to latest…** now also puts your databases back as they were.
- On WotLK, **Update the server to latest…** applies the new code's database updates, so the new build starts.
- When a failed update cannot put the old build back, the message says honestly which build the server is on.
- A rebuild waits for a slow Docker instead of throwing away the build it just finished.
- On WotLK, a kept build is no longer thrown away by a backup, a module update check or a settings save.

- When **Stop** cannot put everything back, the log says what state the server is in and what to press.
- **Restore** on the Maintenance tab works with the server stopped, and leaves it stopped.
- **Re-extract map data** on Centurion works again, and a failed run keeps your old map data.
- Centurion's pathfinding line says how far a stopped run got and what the next press will do.
- On Linux and the Steam Deck, lower-case game file names are accepted on every game, a lower-case Data folder too.
- On Linux and the Steam Deck, a lower-case Interface folder is your client's Interface folder for addons.

- An install that fails part way puts back any file of yours it had moved aside.
- A failed **Re-extract map data** says when part-made pathfinding tiles were kept and will be continued.
- Progress-bar marks from the map tools no longer clutter the install log.
- A fresh WoW TBC or Vanilla install gets the latest dungeon and raid updates.
- WoW WotLK's bots read a real settings file, so My Party, the Bots tab and Tuning see your bot settings.
- **Install** again after a failed build is no longer refused for space its own build cache already uses.
- **Install** again after an install whose world server kept restarting now finishes.

- Removing a server while its **Modules** tab is still loading no longer prints an error.
- An "&" in a label or a server folder's name shows as written.
- A WotLK rebuild with nothing changed no longer re-sends gigabytes to Docker, and still uses a Docker builder you chose.

### Changed
- **Uninstall** now takes every module's files out of your client and puts your own files back.
- A module whose client file has the same name as another module's is refused until the other is removed.
- Failure messages say in plain words what went wrong, with the technical detail under **Details**.

- The Server tab is split into Realm, Play, Client, Command channel and a red-bordered Danger zone.

## v0.8.90-Public — 2026-09-26

- R, L, Space and Backspace type into a text field again.
- A Tortoise server updated onto the new bots module keeps its bots.
- The random-bot count you set survives a Repair, an update and the command channel being switched.

- Turning the command channel on keeps a Fedora server's SELinux labels.
- Installing into the folder that already holds the server is no longer refused for space its build already used.

## v0.8.7-Public — 2026-09-18

### New
- **Update the server to latest…** builds a server from its upstream's newest code, with a backup offered first.

### Fixed
- The Modules tab says which modules are installed.
- A build that fails says what the compiler said.
- On WotLK, the level you choose for a bot in My Party holds after it joins.
- On Linux, the install check no longer tells you to open Docker Desktop.

- Tortoise, Vanilla and TBC come out of a fresh install with the command channel already on.
- Tortoise talks to its world through the command channel again, like the other games.

## v0.8.4-Public — 2026-09-12

### New
- A server's client folder can be set, changed or forgotten on the Server tab after the install.
- The install log shows which step it is on with a progress bar, and colours warnings and refusals.
- The command channel lets Yu'lon talk to a running world, and sets itself up and repairs itself.

### Fixed
- Pressing Yes on a question no longer counts as No.
- A server tab whose folder is gone can be dropped with **Forget this install…**.
- A clash with another install's database names that install's folder, and a failure line can be copied.

### Changed

## v0.8.0-Public — 2026-09-11

### New
- The Server tab shows whether the world is up, restarting or stuck restarting.
- The **Accounts** tab creates accounts, sets passwords and grants or takes away GM rank.

- My Party on WotLK adds a bot, or one of your own, a guild mate's or a linked account's characters, to your party.
- The **Modules** tab shows how far behind each module is, updates it and turns on its settings.
- A module can be installed from a repository link or a folder on this computer.
- **Uninstall…** removes a server, with **Keep my characters** to keep them for later.
- **Rebuild the server…** keeps the old build and puts it back by itself if the new one does not start.

### Fixed
- My Party only dismisses a bot that is still in your party, and says when it cannot confirm the bot left.
- A log panel's **Stop** stops a job that was waiting quietly.
- A paused world server counts as running, so no database change is sent under it.
- A rebuild no longer overwrites a build recipe you changed yourself.
- A rebuild of a server whose address changed no longer waits hours and puts the old build back.
- Upgrading an existing Tortoise install no longer stops on a database update that runs twice.

### Changed
- Before you stop a database job, Yu'lon says what stays applied.
- Turning on a module's settings says when the world must restart to read them.
- The Catalog's two columns are equal at every window size.
