# 🧙 WoW WotLK — Dad's MMO Lab

Run a fully offline **World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King (3.3.5a)** private server on your own hardware — no subscription, no internet required after setup.

**Supported platforms:** Steam Deck (SteamOS) · Ubuntu / Debian / Linux Mint · Fedora · Windows 10/11 (WSL2)

All servers run in **Docker** via [AzerothCore's official Docker compose setup](https://www.azerothcore.org/wiki/install-with-docker). We do not manage nor are we affiliated with AzerothCore — we simply provide a fully automated installer and management scripts for the AzerothCore WotLK + Playerbots server branch.

1. Installs Docker and Git if not already present
2. Shows a build summary and asks you to confirm

## 🧪 ALE-Kegs — Lua Mods

**Folder:** [`ALE-Kegs/`](./ALE-Kegs/)

ALE-Kegs are Eluna Lua mods adapted by Baerthe specifically for this WotLK installation, using the [AzerothCore Lua Engine (ALE)](https://github.com/azerothcore/mod-eluna). They are included in the repo for use with `wow-manage.sh`'s mod installer, but can be used independently.

> These mods are tuned for this specific install. They may need adjustments to work in other AzerothCore setups.

### BlackMarketAuctionHouse
**Folder:** [`ALE-Kegs/BlackMarketAuctionHouse/`](./ALE-Kegs/BlackMarketAuctionHouse/)

Adds a Black Market Auction House to WotLK — a feature originally introduced in Mists of Pandaria. Rare items and gear appear for sale at steep prices, creating a gold sink and rare gear economy on your server.

Contents:
- `BMAH.lua` — the mod (ALE version)
- `BMAH_original.lua` — the unmodified original (reference/fallback)
- `Client Files/` — client-side AddOn files (`BlackMarketUI`)
- `sql/` — database SQL files required for the mod to function

---

### SeasonOfDiscovery
**Folder:** [`ALE-Kegs/SeasonOfDiscovery/`](./ALE-Kegs/SeasonOfDiscovery/)

Adds Season of Discovery-inspired content and mechanics to your WotLK server — bringing SoD's discovery experience to Wrath of the Lich King.

Contents:
- `SOD.lua` — the mod (ALE version)
- `SOD_original.lua` — the unmodified original (reference/fallback)
- `Client Files/` — client-side files (Interface icons and locale data)
- `Server Files/` — server-side DBC files

---

## 📦 legacy/

**Folder:** [`legacy/`](./legacy/)

This folder contains the **old installer scripts** that were used before `install-wow-wotlk.sh` replaced them. They are kept for reference only — **do not use these for a fresh install.**

| File | What it was |
|---|---|
| `install.sh` | Original combined installer |
| `install-wow.sh` | Base WoW (no bots) installer |
| `install-npcbots.sh` | NPCBots server installer |
| `wow-gaming-mode.sh` | Old Gaming Mode setup script |
| `wow-playerbots-launcher.sh` | Old Playerbots launcher |
| `wow-npcbots-launcher.sh` | Old NPCBots launcher |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Old compose file (uses pre-built images, not compiled) |

> **The legacy guides used pre-built AzerothCore Docker images** (pulled from Docker Hub) rather than compiling from source. The current installer compiles from source for full mod support including Playerbots.
