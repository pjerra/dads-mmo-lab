"""Refuse a `-Public` release tag that does not sort above the previous public one.

Run by `release.yml` before anything is built. The update check offers whatever
sorts HIGHEST by `release_notes.version_key`, so a public tag cut at or below
the newest one either never reaches a player (a re-cut, a lower line) or hides
the real release behind a wrong one (a stray `v0.9.2-Public` for `v0.9.20`).
Nothing else stopped such a tag before this (T669).

A ref that is not a `-Public` tag (a branch on a manual run, a `-fixtest` tag)
is nothing to check and exits 0: only public tags are ever offered. Exit 1
means "refused", and so does a tag list that cannot be read - failing open
would wave through the very tag this exists to stop.

Stdlib only, and no import from `yulon`: it runs on a bare checkout. The order
itself is `release_notes.version_key`, the one copy of the rule this directory
carries.

    `tags` is every tag in the repository, `tag` among them. The tag is compared

    above all of them: equal is refused too (`v0.8.7` and `v0.8.70` are one

    ignored, since the update check never offers them (and `tag` itself, if it
