Run by `release.yml` after the artifacts are built. The body does not depend on
`## Unreleased` being retitled: a bullet is news if the previous tag's changelog
lacks it. The cut (`pyplan/contribution.md`, "The changelog") still moves
Unreleased under its release heading so that section stays below the update
dialog's 16 KiB per-release cap. A changelog this script cannot read, or that
gained nothing, leaves the body to GitHub's generated notes.
It exits 0 whatever happens - a release is never refused over its notes.

    Owner's decision, 2026-10-11 (it amends the decimal rule of 2026-09-21):

    * Before 0.9 the last number is a decimal fraction, and it is what the tag
      history has always done. `v0.8.7-Public` was cut on 2026-09-19, six days
      AFTER `v0.8.65-Public`; the whole line reads 0.6.5, 0.6.51 ... 0.6.59,
      0.8.0, 0.8.4, 0.8.5, 0.8.6, 0.8.65, 0.8.7, with the fork's .66 .67 .68
      .69 test tags sitting between .65 and .7. Read as integers, 65 > 7, so
      the notes for the release after 0.8.7 would have been measured against
      0.8.65 and would have re-published everything 0.8.7 already announced.
      "65" is 65/100, "7" is 7/10, "0" is 0, so .6 < .65 < .69 < .7, and .7
      and .70 are the same version.
    * From 0.9 on the last number is a WHOLE number: 0.9.9 < 0.9.10 < 0.9.16,
      and 0.10.9 < 0.10.10. That is how the releases since 0.9 are counted
      (0.9.13, .14, .15, .16). As a decimal, `.10 == .1 < .9`, so the notes of
      v0.10.10 would have been measured against v0.10.0 (T669).

    Major and minor are always whole numbers, so the boundary needs no care:
    `(0, 8, ...) < (0, 9, ...)`. The third part is a `Fraction` on both sides
    so every key stays comparable.

    `Fraction`, not `float`: the comparison is exact, and two tags that mean
    the same version compare equal rather than nearly equal.

    A LEADING ZERO IS PART OF THE FRACTION below 0.9, and that is the point
    rather than a quirk: `.05` is five hundredths and sorts below `.1`, where
    reading the digits as an integer would put it above. From 0.9 on, `.05`
    is just 5.
