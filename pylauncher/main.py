carrying its own copy of this pair would keep passing if someone lowered the
floor -- the size at which a stretch factor stops mattering and the minimum
heights are all there is.

**600 until T85, and it was a promise the Modules tab could not keep.** With the
"A rebuild is owed" banner on screen -- which is the state a user is in for as
long as it takes them to press Rebuild, and the state gate round 6 photographed
-- that tab owes 68px more than it does without one, and 600 is short of it by
more than the whole of `_TabFit`'s ladder: measured themed with a job's log and a
populated report, the tab had 426px and needed 474 with the log folded, the
report folded and the list at `_LIST_FLOOR_FLOOR`. Everything past the ladder is
paid in cut text, and it was paid by the two widgets that have no other way to be
shorter -- the wrapped action bar drawn 82px of its 106 with `Rebuild the
server…` sliced through, and the custom-module card 82 of 122 with both its
buttons below its own edge.

The number is MEASURED and not chosen: swept width by width with the banner up,
the smallest height at which nothing is cut is 634 at 960 wide and rises to 637
between 1090 and 1110, where the theme's font is largest among the widths that
still wrap the bar. 640 is that worst case with three pixels of headroom, so a

    Extracted out of `build_window()` (T28 round 2 review) so a test can lay
    the real catalog tiles out inside the SAME chrome the running app gives
    them, rather than a bare `QSplitter` that skips it. The width a tile
    actually gets is not just "half the window": the tab bar's own frame, the

    False)` / stretch-factor / `setMinimumWidth(_CATALOG_MIN_WIDTH)` rules all

    fixture that reconstructs only the splitter is measuring a window that
    does not exist (round 1's mistake — it happened not to matter for the
    first two tests, and there was no reason to expect that to keep holding).

    actually drag it to (`test_catalog_view.py`'s width matrix). `central` and
    `column` are wiring with nothing left to read once this returns.

    The header goes onto the window as its `header` property rather than into
    this tuple (T90). `build_window()` is the only caller that wants it — for
    `add_action()`, the home of the "Check for updates" button — and a fourth
    element would be a fourth thing for every OTHER caller to name and ignore.
    A property holds a QObject by pointer, which is safe here for the reason

    Two audiences, and neither of them can drive a window.

    Support: "run Yu'lon with --provision and send me the JSON" answers, in one
    step, every question about why Docker will not come up on a user's machine —
    which of the steps ran, which were skipped and why, and what is left that
    only they can do.

    The clean-box harness (checklist 6.3's "proven on a clean box"): on Windows
    every shipped catalog entry is `platforms: ["linux"]`, so the engine's
    `preflight()` refuses before `ensure_docker()` is ever reached and the chain
    cannot be exercised through the app at all. That chain is nonetheless where
    the four Cross-cutting Windows defects live — download over a verified
    connection, silent install, find the executable that was just installed,
    start it, poll for ready, then build an argv from a CLI this process's own
    PATH never contained. This entry point is how those get exercised on a real
    clean box before 6.2/6.3 make them reachable the ordinary way.

    Exit codes are the harness's control flow, not decoration:
      0  ready — a daemon answers and nothing is outstanding
      3  a reboot is required first (`wsl --install` forces one on a box with no
         WSL), so nothing after it can be judged yet; reboot and run again
      2  not ready, and what remains needs a human

    On Linux, 2 is the *expected* outcome rather than a fault: there is nobody
    here to ask about joining the docker group, and the app never makes a
    root-equivalent change with nobody asked, so the engine is installed and
    the one step only the user may take is printed for them to run.

    A `QThread` destroyed while running does not warn — it ABORTS the process
    (0xC0000409, verified): closing the window mid-install or while following
    a log must first stop and join those panels (review finding, 2026-08-21).

    This runs from `main()`'s `finally`, AFTER `app.exec()` has returned, so
    nothing is pumping the main thread's event queue while `panel.wait()`
    blocks in it. That is not incidental — it is why the join has to be able to
    complete without one, and for a while it could not: a panel's worker
    reached its thread only through `worker.finished -> thread.quit`, a queued
    connection into this very thread. Measured: `wait(3000)` returned False
    with the worker long finished, and Qt was then torn down with the QThread
    still running — the abort above, arriving through the function meant to
    prevent it. `LogPanel`'s worker now ends its own thread's loop directly
    (see `_StreamWorker.run()`), and `ThreadedJobRunner.wait()` quits each
    thread before waiting on it. Nothing here may go back to relying on a
    queued quit (review, 2026-08-23).

    What a close mid-install does NOT do, and never did, is register the
    install: `_on_finished` is queued into this same blocked thread, so
    `run_finished` never fires, `CatalogView._on_run_finished()` never runs and
    nothing is written to `state.json` on this path.

    The answer is every thread still running after its join, named; empty
    when everything finished. A non-empty answer means a job's work is blocked
    where `quit()` cannot reach it, and `main()` must not return into a
    teardown with it still running (T113). EVERY join's result counts, not only
    `wait_all`'s: today each panel's and the update check's thread is also held
    by `in_flight()`, so its survivor would be named there too, but a thread
    this function joins and nobody else holds must not be able to slip through
    on that coincidence. A survivor both lists name is named once, by the
    label its owner gave it (`LogPanel.job_label`, `UPDATE_CHECK_LABEL`).

    The controllers' `shutdown()` joins are not collected here: their jobs run
    in `ThreadedJobRunner`, whose every pair `in_flight()` holds, and their
    panels are in `yulon_log_panels`. The gamepad's thread is not held by
    `in_flight()` on this branch (T111 moves it there).

    - `yulon.runner._close_abandoned_streams` - RUN here: it ends a `stream()`
      child nobody closed, which would otherwise outlive the app with PPID 1.
      It may also be what unblocks the stuck job, if that job was reading one.
    - `logging.shutdown` - RUN here, after the above so its lines land: the
      file handler's buffer is support's only record of this exit.
    - `PySide6.QtCore.__moduleShutdown` - NOT run: it is the Qt teardown this
      function exists to avoid.
    - `pygame.base.quit` - NOT run: `SDL_Quit` from this thread while the
      stuck thread may be inside an SDL poll is a second way to hang or crash,
      and the OS releases the joystick handles when the process ends.

    Nothing is connected to `aboutToQuit`, and it has fired inside `app.exec()`
