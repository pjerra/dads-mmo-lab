    Two audiences, and neither of them can drive a window.

    Support: "run Yu'lon with --provision and send me the JSON" answers, in one
    step, every question about why Docker will not come up on a user's machine —
    which of the steps ran, which were skipped and why, and what is left that
    only they can do.

    The clean-box harness (checklist 6.3's "proven on a clean box"): on Windows
    every shipped catalog entry is `platforms: ["linux"]`, so the engine's
    `preflight()` refuses before `ensure_docker()` is ever reached and the chain
    cannot be exercised through the app at all. That chain is nonetheless where
    the four Cross-cutting Windows defects live — download over a verified
    connection, silent install, find the executable that was just installed,
    start it, poll for ready, then build an argv from a CLI this process's own
    PATH never contained. This entry point is how those get exercised on a real
    clean box before 6.2/6.3 make them reachable the ordinary way.

    Exit codes are the harness's control flow, not decoration:
      0  ready — a daemon answers and nothing is outstanding
      3  a reboot is required first (`wsl --install` forces one on a box with no
         WSL), so nothing after it can be judged yet; reboot and run again
      2  not ready, and what remains needs a human

    On Linux, 2 is the *expected* outcome rather than a fault: there is nobody
    here to ask about joining the docker group, and the app never makes a
    root-equivalent change with nobody asked, so the engine is installed and
    the one step only the user may take is printed for them to run.

    a log must first stop and join those panels (review finding, 2026-08-21).

    This runs from `main()`'s `finally`, AFTER `app.exec()` has returned, so
    nothing is pumping the main thread's event queue while `panel.wait()`
    blocks in it. That is not incidental — it is why the join has to be able to
    complete without one, and for a while it could not: a panel's worker
    reached its thread only through `worker.finished -> thread.quit`, a queued
    connection into this very thread. Measured: `wait(3000)` returned False
    with the worker long finished, and Qt was then torn down with the QThread
    still running — the abort above, arriving through the function meant to
    prevent it. `LogPanel`'s worker now ends its own thread's loop directly
    (see `_StreamWorker.run()`), and `ThreadedJobRunner.wait()` quits each
    thread before waiting on it. Nothing here may go back to relying on a
    queued quit (review, 2026-08-23).

    What a close mid-install does NOT do, and never did, is register the
