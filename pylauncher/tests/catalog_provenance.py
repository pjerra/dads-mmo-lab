"""Where every value the catalog writes down about a tree came from.

Test support, not shipped code — it sits beside `write_sites.py` for the same
reason and by the same precedent: `write_sites.py` holds the ledger's RULES
while `pyplan/write-ledger.md` holds the table a person reads, and this module
is the other half of that pairing for the catalog. The design and its open
questions live in `pyplan/phase8-designs/d-catalog-provenance.md`.

**The problem this exists for.** Phase 8's exit line asks that "every value
still marked unverified in the catalog's operations block [be] replaced by a
measured one, and that set enumerated by name in the catalog test rather than
left to memory" (`pyplan/checklist.md`). Nothing enumerated it. "Measured"
lived in prose, in the model docstrings, and the prose is written PER FIELD
while the values are per field PER GAME — `Equipped`'s docstring says the flat
shape was "measured on the TBC install 2026-09-06 and on the Vanilla one
2026-09-07", which is four trees' worth of values and two trees' worth of
measurements in one sentence, and no way to ask which of the four a given value
belongs to. So a value could be measured here, read off somebody's header, or
copied from a sibling, and all three read identically in the file.

That last one is the expensive one. `per-tree facts are measured per tree,
never inherited from a sibling emulator` is a rule this project has already
paid a night for, and an inherited value is invisible precisely because it is
CORRECT-LOOKING: 8.4c found `mail_item_cap: 1` sitting in the catalog as what
its own README calls "a **source-cited prediction** … A prediction the server
has never been asked is not a measurement."

**The catalog wrote this design out by hand once, in prose, and nothing could
read it.** `AzerothCoreData.world_env`'s description (`catalog.py:202`) says
"PROVENANCE: WotLK carried 1600/2000, copied from the ONE proven yulon-ubuntu
install … Never measured on another machine and never measured at all for RAM …
Still owed an RSS reading by the first gate" — an inherited kind, a citation and
an owed debt, in one field, reachable by no test. This module is that sentence
made uniform.

**The three kinds, and why three.** The vocabulary is 8.4c's own, generalised:

* `measured-on` — this tree's own running install was ASKED and this is its
  answer. Console, SOAP or SQL: what makes it a measurement is the live server,
  not the transport. The citation is a page under `pyplan/` and it must
  resolve; a citation that resolves to nothing is how `8.3c`'s README came to
  name `tests/test_srp6.py`, a file never written under that name (`dcc64543`).
* `read-from-source` — read off this tree's own source at a named `path:line`.
  A prediction. Honest, useful, and not the same thing as an answer. Not
  resolvable from here: we do not vendor the emulator trees, so the shape is
  checked and the content is not, and that limit is stated rather than hidden.
* `inherited` — carried over from a sibling tree; nobody asked this one. The
  dangerous kind, and the reason the marker is worth having at all.

**What is NOT here.** A fourth kind for "measured, but the reading is not in
the tree" was considered and refused: `wow-tortoise:accounts.scheme` is exactly
that case, and it is in `OWED` below rather than given a kind of its own,
because a kind that means "trust the docstring" is the state this module
replaces. Owing it keeps it on a list somebody has to answer.
