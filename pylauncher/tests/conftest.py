    inherits the real `HOME` from the suite. Measured on m910q 2026-09-05, the
    whole suite run under a stand-in home (`HOME=/tmp/red-home`) with this
    rewrite removed: `/tmp/red-home/.local/share/yulon/yulon.log` was created
    and written -- the same appending-to-support's-evidence the in-process
    guard was added to stop, through the one door it does not cover.

    What wrote it was `test_log.py`'s own probe child, and that is worth being
    exact about: of the three sites where this suite already spawns the app,
    none writes the user's log TODAY, because each happens to point its child
    at a directory of its own. The hole is that nothing said they had to. The
    in-process rule had exactly the same shape until `test_spine.py` grew a
    fourth `install_wiring.main()` call and wrote 54,500 bytes into the real
    file.

    Same conditional shape as the in-process redirect, for the same reason: a
    variable the CALLER named is left exactly as the caller named it, so
    `test_main.py`'s deliberately unwritable `APPDATA` and
    `test_every_entry_point_that_runs_for_a_user_leaves_the_same_log_behind`'s
    per-entry-point `XDG_DATA_HOME` still reach the child. "Named by the
    caller" is `var in given` AND a value that differs from what this process
    would have handed down.

    `var in given` is load-bearing, and was missing until 2026-09-05 (review,
    round 3). Without it an OMITTED variable also "differs" -- `given.get(var)`
    is `None` -- so a partial `env=` dict read as four deliberate unsets and
    every one of the four was DROPPED from the child's environment instead of
    being pointed at the scratch home. An unset route is not a closed one: on
    POSIX `Path.home()` falls back to the passwd database, which is the user's
    own, and on macOS that is `config_dir()`'s only input.

    Measured on m910q 2026-09-05, a probe child spawned the way the suite
    spawns one and handed `{"EXIT_CODE": "3", "PYTHONPATH": ...}`: under
    `-n 2 --dist loadfile` it reached the OS with all four unset and
    answered `/home/user/.local/share/yulon`, the user's own; serially only
    `HOME` was dropped (the box's own `XDG_DATA_HOME` was unset, so that
    one compared equal to the omission and was rewritten) and the child
    landed on the scratch. Green on the spelling CI runs, open on the
    spelling the local gate runs.

    That is not a shape only a probe can make. `runner.interact(...,
    env={"EXIT_CODE": "3"})` in
    `test_installer.py::test_interact_raises_on_nonzero_exit_after_yielding_output`
    reaches `Popen(env=child_env(env))` with that one-key dict verbatim --
    `yulon/runner.py:241` returns it unchanged off-frozen, `:623` spawns
    with it (read, not run). The round-3 review's census of `-n auto --dist
    loadfile` on m910q, same date, found 138 real children and exactly that
    one holding all four routes as `None`; it runs `bash`, so nothing was
    written that day, which is word for word this guard's own argument for
    why the in-process rule's shape was a hole.

    A caller that names one of them AS the user's own directory is refused
    outright rather than rewritten, exactly as `_guarded_open_log` refuses it
    in-process: rewriting would hide the mistake, and the caller stated an
    intent that the suite may not carry out.

    Two separate leaks, measured on m910q 2026-09-05 by a probe test run after
    `tests/test_spine.py` in the same process:

    * `stderr handler pinned at WARNING`. `configure(stderr_level=...)` applies
      a level to the handler module-scope `get_logger()` built at import, which
      is the point of it — and nothing ever takes that level off again, so one
      `install_wiring.main()` in a test silences INFO on stderr for the rest of
      the process. Every handler that was there before the test gets its level
      back.
    * `leaked file handlers:
      ['/home/user/.local/share/yulon/yulon.log']`. A `RotatingFileHandler` a
      test opened stays on the root logger, writing every record the remaining
      ~2,450 tests emit into a directory that is usually deleted underneath
      it. Those are removed and closed, and `_file_configured` is recomputed
      from the handlers that remain, so the module's idea of "done" matches the
      handlers that actually exist.

    A handler that is NEITHER in `levels` NOR a file handler is left exactly
    alone: pytest puts its own `LogCaptureHandler` on the root logger per
    phase, and a teardown that removed everything it did not recognise would
    take `caplog`'s with it.

    `_file_configured` is RECOMPUTED rather than restored, and that is the half
    that decides whether the NEXT test gets a log at all: `configure()` opens
    the file at most once per process, so a run that left the flag True hands
    every test after it a `configure(config_dir=...)` that quietly does
    nothing. Measured on m910q 2026-09-05 before this moved here, as
    `test_install_wiring.py`'s own fixture: green serially (i sorts before s)
    and two failures under `-n auto --dist loadfile`, on gw3. `_file_problem`
    goes with it, so one test's unwritable directory is never another test's
    diagnosis.

    Recomputed from the handlers that REMAIN, and not simply set to False,
    because the two answers differ for a file handler that was in `levels` --
    one that existed before the test, was therefore not leaked by it, and is
    left in place by the loop above. `False` there would tell the module that
    file logging is off while the handler is still on the root logger, and the
    next `configure(config_dir=...)` would open a second one. No test in the
    suite produces that state on its own today, so the branch is driven
    directly by
    `test_log.py::test_a_file_handler_that_was_already_there_keeps_file_logging_marked_done`;

    both ways: at `6546b190` the user's own log grew by 0 bytes; one commit
    later, with the CLI harness configuring file logging the way every other
    entry point does, it grew by **54,500 bytes** — 2,876,987 to 2,931,487 —
    and its last two lines were a fabricated `install of wow-wotlk finished`
    and the warning from a worker the fixture abandoned. That file is what a
    user sends to support. A suite that appends invented installs to it has
    destroyed the evidence it exists to preserve, and neither the fix nor the
    tests were wrong about anything else: nothing in the suite had ever said
    where a test's `config_dir()` may point.

    Three things, in the order they matter:

    * **The redirect.** `platform.config_dir()` answers a scratch directory
      whenever the real function would have answered one no test chose --
      the user's own, or the ambient one an `xdist` worker inherits. Only
      then, so the five `test_platform.py` tests that drive `config_dir()`
      against a made-up `$HOME`/`%APPDATA%` still see their own answer, and so
      a test that sets up its own directory keeps it. This is what makes
      `test_spine.py`'s four `install_wiring.main()` sites harmless without
      any of them knowing about logging at all.
    * **The guard**, `_guarded_open_log` above, which is not part of this
      fixture at all: it is installed once at import, so that collection and a
      background thread are covered too. The redirect is the fix; the guard is
      what makes the fix provable, and it fails loudly in whatever asked.
      `test_log.py` drives it directly.
    * **The restore.** `install_wiring.main()` calls
      `configure(stderr_level=WARNING)`, which pins a process-global handler
      for good, and leaves a file handler on the root logger behind it. Both
      are undone by `restore_root_logging()`, which carries the measurements
      and the reasoning; `test_log.py` drives it directly, because a fixture
      cannot assert on its own teardown.

    All three are IN-PROCESS, and that was the whole of the rule until
    2026-09-05 (review). A child process has its own `platform.config_dir`,
    its own `log._open_log` and the real `HOME` this one was started with, so
    none of the three can see it -- and this suite spawns the app as a child
    at three sites. The child half is
    `child_env_with_the_users_own_log_out_of_reach`, installed on

the worst of them --
`test_log_panel.py::test_a_runner_dropped_before_its_thread_runs_does_not_leave_the_worker_dead`,
the one bug-checklist section 33 names -- reported `0.03s call` on an idle box,

and two thousand times the idle one, and the spread is what sizes it: a box
loaded 25x over its cores moved this test by a factor of 30, not of 2000.

The number is large on purpose, because the bound is on THIS PROCESS and the
contention is on the BOX. `test_steam_deck_script.py` records what a
stopwatch-sized bound cost: 60 seconds against a run measured at 0.16s went
red under 15-way parallel load, passed 14 of 14 re-run serially, and the run it
happened in was read as a real single failure -- three clean re-runs later a
merge went through on a result nobody had explained. Contention is bounded,
some multiple of a run costing milliseconds; a hang is unbounded, and any
finite bound catches an unbounded wait eventually. (That file keeps its own
`HANG_BOUND`, sized by its own measurements of a bash subprocess.)

Deleting the bounds is not an option. Every wait here is on work whose only way
out is a queued slot on this thread, so a wedged subject with no bound is a
suite that never returns -- which CI reports as a stuck job rather than a red
one. A minute per genuinely wedged test is the price of reporting it as a
failure.

Rejected: a bound proportional to measured load, which needs a calibration step
that is itself load-sensitive -- when it fires you cannot tell a hang from a
starved calibration. And a merely bigger number with no name, which is the same
defect with a bigger constant: what changed is that the argument for the size
travels with it, and that expiry says WHICH of the two happened (`pump_until`).

    route and the commit message claimed all of them; adding it changed no

    NEXT accidental reach, not a defect today. `exec_stdin()` is still open:
