"""One vocabulary for "what does this compose stack look like", from two sources.

`shape_from_plan()` reads the three files the engine renders (YAML, with compose's
`${VAR:-default}` interpolation resolved to the default, which is what compose does with no
`.env`). `shape_from_config()` reads `docker compose config --format json` from a real install.
Both produce `Service` records built from the fields the 2026-08-24 diff compared by hand
(`pyplan/checklist.md`, "The compose diff against the proven install"): image, container name,
ports, depends_on, restart, environment keys, volumes, build. `stack_from_plan()`/
`stack_from_config()` do the same for the top-level `name:`/`volumes:`/`networks:` blocks, which
no per-service record can see. `compare()` and `compare_stack()` then report every difference
that is not one of the documented design differences, so the fixture test and the live gate diff
read the same list.

WHY EACH RULE ERASES WHAT IT ERASES. A normaliser's rules are differences it will never report
again, so every one of them is here because the two sources legitimately disagree, and each is
paired in `test_compose_fixture.py` with a test that a meaningful change in the same area is
still caught:

* `${VAR:-default}` → `default`. The rendered files are pre-interpolation text; `compose config`
  is post-interpolation JSON. The default is what compose picks with no `.env`, which is the
  state both sides were captured in. The default itself is NOT erased: a template that starts
  publishing 13306 says so.
* image → its last path component. The registry prefix and the tag are a recorded design
  difference (`yulon.local/ac-wotlk-worldserver:native-<install id>` against upstream's
  `acore/ac-wotlk-worldserver:master`); the NAME is not, and `mysql` against `mariadb` is
  reported.
* named volume → `<named>` at its target. This rule was written when the reference was going to
  be UPSTREAM's script install, whose two volumes are `ac-database` and `ac-client-data` against
  our `db-data` and `client-data`. The captured fixture is a NATIVE install and declares
  `db-data` and `client-data` — our own names — so at the mount level the erasure no longer buys
  a real difference and is a blind spot instead of a justification: it cannot see a mount that
  was pointed at the other existing volume. What it never hid is a RENAME:
  `compare_stack()` compares the top-level declarations by name, translating only what a
  pairing's registry records. Both halves are pinned by
  `test_a_renamed_named_volume_is_caught_at_the_top_level_not_at_the_mount`. The KIND survives,
  so a bind where a managed volume belongs is still reported, and so does READ-ONLY: only the
  SELinux label characters are dropped from the mode column (below), never `ro`.
* bind source → relative to the install dir, always with forward slashes. It is an absolute host
  path that is `/home/pk/...` on the proven box, `C:\\...` on the Windows gate and a pytest tmp
  dir here, and ONE committed fixture has to serve all three. Only paths actually under the
  install dir are stripped, so a sibling `/home/pk/srv-backup` stays absolute rather than
  becoming `./-backup`. `_under()` carries that comparison and the Windows rules: `\\` is a
  separator and case is folded only for a path SHAPED like a Windows one, never because of the
  host the reduction happens to run on.
* mount mode → `ro` or `rw`, and nothing else. The label characters (`z`, `Z`) are this engine's
  SELinux suffix, which the proven install has no equivalent for; that is the whole of the
  justification, so it buys the removal of exactly those characters. `ro` is readable on both
  sides — `compose config` gives it its own `read_only` field — and a client-data mount that
  lost it is a real regression, so it is compared.
* environment → KEYS only. The values carry a per-install DB password and the proven box's own
  paths, and reproducing them is not this engine's job. Whether a key is present at all is.
* `depends_on` → sorted (service, condition) pairs. Compose does not preserve the mapping's
  order, and the short list form leaves the condition implicit at `service_started` — which is
  read out rather than blanked, because a weakened edge is exactly the kind of difference this
  fixture exists to find.
* a top-level `volumes:`/`networks:` declaration → its options UNDER ITS OWN KEY, with only
  compose's per-project `name:` value dropped (that one is per-install by construction:
  `compose config` writes `<project>_client-data` where the file says `client-data`). The key is
  kept, because a declaration carries options and options must stay attached to an identity — a
  `driver_opts.device` that moved from one 1.1 GB store to the other is otherwise invisible, and
  a problem line that does not name the volume cannot be acted on. Names are compared as
  written unless the PAIRING'S OWN registry records a rename: `NO_VOLUME_ALIASES` for the native
  fixture, whose two volumes the engine named itself, and `SCRIPT_INSTALL_VOLUME_NAMES` for the
  bash script install, which really does call them `ac-database` and `ac-client-data`. A `Stack`
  remembers which registry reduced it, so the two can never be compared across.
* a service that names no `networks:` → compose's implicit `default`, on both sides, and a
  top-level `default:` declaration synthesised for the rendered files when some service names
  none. `compose config` materialises both; the file can spell neither. This is the same
  pre-resolution/post-resolution split as `${VAR:-default}`, and it is MODELLED rather than
  erased: the synthesised declaration carries no options, so a `default:` that grew any on the
  captured side is still reported.
* the published host IP is NOT erased, and used to be. Both sources can spell it — ours inside
  the `${...:-127.0.0.1:7878}` default, `compose config` as a `host_ip` field — and the bash
  script install publishes MySQL and the SOAP console on every interface where this stack pins
  both to loopback. Dropping it called those identical.
* upstream's build-time env (`BUILD_TIME_ENV`, `BUILD_TIME_ENV_PREFIXES`) → forgiven when only
  the PROVEN install has it. Upstream's compose sets these on the runtime services and the
  image's entrypoint reads none of them (checked in the image, 2026-08-24), so the native stack
  drops them on purpose. The allowance is one-directional: the same key appearing only in the
  native stack is still reported, because that would mean the engine started writing them.

WHAT THIS VOCABULARY CANNOT SEE, so that "the diff is clean" is never read as "the two files
match". `Service` has no field for the image tag, an environment VALUE, `stop_grace_period`, the
healthcheck, `user`, `tty`/`stdin_open`, `entrypoint`/`command`, the build context or the build
`args` — and `volume_from_config()` does not read a bind's `selinux` field, so the script
install's single `Z` on the modules tree meets this engine's `z` on every bind in silence.
The first two are the cost of the rules above; the rest are fields this reduction does not carry.
Each is named by a test in `test_compose_fixture.py`, and where another test file already owns
the value it is named there too — `stop_grace_period`, the healthcheck and `user:` are asserted
on the rendered side by `test_composegen.py`. One pair is owned by no ASSERTION anywhere else
and so is asserted in `test_compose_fixture.py` itself: `ac-client-data-init`'s `entrypoint` and
`command`, the ~45-line resumable downloader that REPLACES upstream's un-resumable
`curl … > data.zip` and is the largest deliberate divergence in the stack. Its text IS in the
byte snapshot under `tests/data/wotlk-rendered/`, but a snapshot is a change-detector whose
documented remedy is regeneration — it says the file changed, never that the script must be able
to resume.
