"""The machine double every native-engine test file drives (roadmap 7.1).

A plain module, not a conftest: `test_spine.py` and
`test_families_azerothcore.py` import what they use by name, so a reader of
either file can see where `Recorder` comes from.

**Every double here must be able to give the answers the real function gives,
including the ones that make the engine refuse.** Four blockers survived 677
green tests and a 41-mutation run on the first version of `test_native.py`,
and all four survived for the same reason: the doubles could not produce the
real answer. `container_project` returned `None` for a container that does not
exist, where the real one returns `UNREADABLE`; the import probe returned
`absent` with no database running, which the real probe cannot do; the clone
double made a bare `.git` directory, where a real clone of that repository also
lays down its own `docker-compose.yml`; and there was no case at all for the
port scan listing our own containers. So `Recorder` models a machine — what
containers exist on it, what git has, what the database can answer and when —
rather than answering each question the way the code under test would like.
