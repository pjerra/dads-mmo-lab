"""SRP6 account creation against rows AzerothCore itself wrote.

`SERVER_WRITTEN` is not a vector this project computed. Both accounts were
created by the worldserver over its console on the Ubuntu test box on
2026-08-23 (`account create …` at the `AC>` prompt on AzerothCore rev
`9fb906bb7296+`), and their `salt`/`verifier` read straight back out of
`acore_auth.account` with `SELECT HEX(salt), HEX(verifier)`. They were deleted
afterwards. So these tests compare our arithmetic against the server's, which is
the only comparison that means anything here — a vector we generated ourselves
would only prove our code agrees with our code.

The `Café1234` row is the one that discriminates. Every plausible wrong
implementation still matches on a pure-ASCII password.

    It keeps the two schema facts the module actually leans on: `account` is
    keyed by the folded username, and `account_access` rejects a second plain
    INSERT for an account that already has a row, exactly as MySQL's
    `(id, RealmID)` primary key does.

    It keys `access` by account id ALONE, so what it really models is a primary
    key of `(id)`. That is indistinguishable here — every write this module
    makes uses `RealmID = ALL_REALMS` — and it still kills the
    ON-DUPLICATE-KEY mutation, so the test is sound; but a future test that
    writes a second realm would find the fake stricter than the database
    (review, 2026-08-23).

    `fail_on` is a statement prefix that raises `failure` instead of running,
