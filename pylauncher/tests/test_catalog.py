    The whole field set is compared, not the names that were deleted: a
    mutation adding `bash_file` — the script field back under a name that
    never says "script" — survived a substring check and dies here.

    ORDER MATTERS, and it was wrong when this was written. The substring line
    was placed AFTER the set comparison and could therefore never fail: any
    field name containing "script" already breaks the set, so the set assertion
    always fired first. Its docstring claimed it "stays anyway, because it fails
    with the offending name in the message" — a purpose the written order
    forbade. Found by review 2026-09-02, proved by a mutation that restored a
    real `script` field and watched the set assertion be the one that fell. It
    now runs first, which is the only arrangement in which that reason is true.

    LIMIT, recorded rather than fixed: this enumerates `Install`'s own fields
    and namespace. Measured 2026-09-02, three shapes survive it — a plain
    `@property`, a `@computed_field @property`, and a `script` field on the
    NESTED `NativeInstall`. What backstops them is
    `test_the_shipped_catalog_names_no_bash_file`: a re-added field only matters
    once it carries `.sh` data, and that test walks the JSON. A guard that
    enumerates one model says nothing about its neighbours.

    `is_native` is named on its own because it is the one deleted symbol whose
    name does not say "script": it meant "supported, but not by the script",
    and with a single install path left it could only be a synonym for

    `install.<field>`) and to no other rule.

    THE REASON THIS MATTERS, corrected 2026-09-02 after review. The reason first
    given here was that `match="script"` could also match a `default_server_dir`
    error mentioning a `.sh` path — and that is not reproducible against this
    fixture, whose `default_server_dir` is `"d"`. A confident reason with nothing
    behind it, attached to a correct decision.

    The demonstrable reason is a different rule on the SAME field. Measured: with
    a real `script: Literal["none"]` field restored to `Install`, `"script":
    "s.sh"` is refused by `literal_error` at `install.script` rather than by
    `extra_forbidden` — and the `match=`-based form PASSES, green, with the
    deleted field back in the model. The `(loc, type)` comparison fails, naming
    it. Proved in both directions: with `extra="ignore"` on `Install` alone,
    every case here fails with DID NOT RAISE rather than with some other error,
    so no neighbouring rule refuses this fixture at all.

  2026-09-04 (`pyplan/gates/7.7-win11-tbc/source-identity.txt`) was on

  with the full evidence chain (build, extract, import, boot, login) on the
  primary platform, and that note itself establishes the one commit between
  them touches `src/game` only, so the Windows result stands on either.

    `server_dir` to read a generated file from. `ControllerServices.for_wotlk()`

    does read that file. Today the two agree, and only because the one entry

    that names a `db_import` container is wow-wotlk, whose plan is `fixed`.



    An entry that named an import service AND generated its password would send

    the probe to the database as root with the literal "password" while every

    other control used the real one. The symptom is not a silent Repair offer:

    `repair.import_state()` cannot read the schemas, answers `unreadable`, and

    the spine turns that into a hard `InstallerError` - so the install fails at

    the import stage with a message about the database being unreadable, which

    is a confusing way to say "wrong password".



    If you are reading this because the test went red, you added such an entry.

    Either give it `"mode": "fixed"`, or teach `import_gate_for()` to be handed

    a password by a caller that holds a `server_dir` (a contract change - see

    the 7.1 interface contract's `install_wiring` block). Do NOT make

# an edit that drops one of these sources takes the build down at `cmake`, and
# takes this test down first.

    """The clone stage does not run `git submodule update`, so each gitlink is a source.

    Measured on m910q 2026-09-02: the Tortoise build died at configure with
    `CMakeLists.txt:50 (message): Eluna submodule is missing.  Run: git
    submodule update --init --recursive src/modules/Eluna`. `clone-sources` had
    cloned the fork and nothing had fetched its submodules, so the gitlink left
    an empty `src/modules/Eluna` behind.

    Nothing here needs a submodule to BE a submodule. That CMake guard is
    `if(NOT EXISTS "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/src/modules/Eluna/LuaEngine.h")` and
    reads no git metadata at all, so an ordinary clone parked at the pinned
    commit satisfies it — which is why the fix is a row of data beside the core
    rather than engine support for `.gitmodules`.

    Three properties, and each one is a way the fix silently stops working:

    * The **rev** is the sha the superproject pins. Without it the clone takes
      whatever `ElunaLuaEngine/Eluna` publishes next against a fork that has not
      moved, which is a compile error nobody edited anything to cause.
    * The **order** — every submodule after the core that contains it.
      `stage_clone_sources()` walks the list in order and refuses a dest that
      holds files but no `.git`, so a submodule cloned FIRST turns the core's
      own clone into "move that folder aside and try again".
    * The **depth**, left at 1. Measured here on 2026-09-02, running the argv
      `git.py` runs: a `--depth 1` clone of Eluna's default branch (`master`),
      then `fetch --depth=1 origin <sha>` and `checkout --detach <sha>`,
      succeeded and left `LuaEngine.h` on disk in 5.6 MB. That is why no
      `branch` is spelled: the pinned commit was the head of a side branch
      (`cmangos-spell-update`), `_pin()` fetches it by hash regardless, and
      naming a branch that upstream may delete would break the clone outright
      where the default branch will not.

"""The one patch that ships, and which entries carry it against which checkout.

`wow-tortoise` carries none, and not by oversight. Its extractor is the older
lineage whose `wmo.cpp` runs `fixnamen()` over the whole MODN block in place
before either the writer or the reader looks at a name (read 2026-09-05 at
`7c0fb278`, `tools/vmap_extractor/vmapextract/wmo.cpp:98`). Reading is what
that was, and reading is how the same conclusion was reached about
`mangos-classic` before the extraction disproved half of it, so it was RUN:
on m910q 2026-09-05 that extractor was built from `7c0fb278` in a container
and run against the Turtle client (86 s, exit 0, 5,367 files in `Buildings/`),
and `extract.doodad_placements()` over its output answers
`DoodadCheck(extracted=4041, placed=2675, unplaced=1366, misspelt=0)` -- zero
all-caps `.M2`, zero names with a space, and not one file spelled a way the
placement index would not ask for. Writer and reader agree there, measured.

`mangos-wotlk` is not a shipped entry (`wow-wotlk` is AzerothCore)
and its `ExtractSingleModel` already normalises (read the same day at
`4cea3890`), which is why the patch refuses to apply there and nothing asks it to.
