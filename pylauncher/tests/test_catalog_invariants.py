"""Cross-file invariants of `catalog.json` and the templates it names (roadmap 7.3, task G.7).

Every case is enumerated over the shipped catalog rather than over a list of ids, because
the point of one engine per lineage is that the same rule holds for every game it serves.
A red here names a drift in DATA or in a TEMPLATE, and the fix belongs in the file the
assertion names rather than in the number that made it red. One case is not like that:
the derived game-word set at the bottom has measured false positives, recorded in
`game_words()`, so a red from `test_family_modules_contain_no_game_literal` is read
before it is believed and may be answered by rewording prose. Nothing here starts a
container or reads a network.

**What this file deliberately does NOT assert.** `"cmangos" in families.FAMILIES` is a
declaration, and the 7.3 plan had this task assert it. The property it gestures at is owned
by two tests that cross the whole path instead:
`tests/test_families_cmangos.py::test_every_cmangos_entry_dispatches_to_an_engine_that_runs_this_familys_stages`
and `tests/test_spine.py::test_every_shipped_native_entry_reaches_the_class_its_family_id_names`.
Both go from a catalog entry through `installer_for()` to the object that comes back and ask
that object what stages it runs. A membership check beside them would be the weakest claim in
the file, and it would pass on the day either of those failed.

**Catalog data that outruns its engine is a defect, not a window.** Until F.3 an entry whose
family had no registered engine fell back to the bash `Installer`; F.3 deleted that script and
the branch that reached it, so `family_for()` now refuses such an entry with a sentence — and
`families.is_registered()`, the predicate whose docstring still called that state a supported
window, was deleted with this task because nothing had called it since.

    Two filters. A value more than one entry carries is a word of the lineage or
    of English — `server`, `characters`, `mangos` — and the first two appear in
    dozens of user-facing sentences in these modules. A stage name is Python's
    vocabulary: `client-data` is AzerothCore's fourth stage and also its third
    image, and the stage tuple is where that word belongs.

    **What the filters cost, MEASURED against the tree on 2026-09-02** (four
    entries, 126 words: wow-tbc 36, wow-vanilla 34, wow-tortoise 32, wow-wotlk
    24). None of the four below was reasoned about; each was run.

    * The set is not a superset of what an engine would plausibly hardcode.
      `Avg Diff:` is `install.native.ready.world` for BOTH wow-tbc and
      wow-vanilla, so the uniqueness filter deletes it — and a ready marker is
      the single most likely thing a family engine would hardcode.
    * Nothing about the CMaNGOS in-image layout is protected. `/opt/mangos/etc`,
      `mangosd.conf`, `Avg Diff:`, `/opt/mangos/bin/tools/MoveMapGen` and
      `vmap_extractor` were each put through the check as a literal in a family
      module and all five passed. wow-tbc and wow-vanilla are byte-identical in
      `conf.source_dir`, `conf.files`, `mmaps.argv` and two of three
      `extract.tools`, which is why.
    * It DECAYS as the catalog grows, which is the growth one engine per lineage
      exists for. Cloning `wow-wotlk` as a sibling `wow-wotlk-hd` took wow-wotlk
      from 24 words to 2 (`wotlk`, `wow-wotlk`) and gave the clone 1, and
      `test_the_catalog_words_catch_something` still passed — that control asks
      only whether each game contributes at least one word, and an entry's own
      id always survives.
    * It has false positives, and they are ordinary English. `dbc` (wow-tbc's)
      and `worldserver`, `authserver`, `12340` (wow-wotlk's) turn a family
      module red wherever they appear, in a sentence as readily as in data:
      "extract the dbc files before the maps" and "the worldserver container
      never came back" are both red. `native.py` already yields *"Waiting for
      the world server to finish loading"*, which is one respelling away.

    So a red from `test_family_modules_contain_no_game_literal` is read before
    it is believed, and the answer may be to reword prose rather than to move
    data. Redesigning the filter is a follow-up; this is the honest account of
    what it does today.

# catalog's operations block [be] replaced by a measured one, and that set
# enumerated by name in the catalog test rather than left to memory". Nothing
# enumerated it, and "measured" lived only in the model docstrings -- which are
# written per FIELD while the values are per field per GAME, so no single value
# could be asked where it came from. `tests/catalog_provenance.py` holds the
# table and the vocabulary; `pyplan/phase8-designs/d-catalog-provenance.md`
# holds the design and the questions left open.
#
# The ground before these five landed, recorded because a guard that was already
# true proves nothing: at `dcc64543` the string "provenance" did not appear in
# `pylauncher/yulon/` or in any catalog test, and the 39 values `catalog.json`
# writes under a game's `play` or `accounts` block carried no marker of any kind.
