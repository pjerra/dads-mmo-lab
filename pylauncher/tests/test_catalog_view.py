    """The cancel modal, on the folder a real stopped clone leaves. Clicked, not called.

    Shaped after the driver that found this,
    `pyplan/gates/7.2-ubuntu-2026-09-05/widget_cancel_driver.py`: a real
    `CatalogView` over a real `LogPanel`, Install pressed with
    `QTest.mouseClick` on the tile's own button and Stop pressed the same way
    on the panel's. Everything that run drove for real is real here except the
    engine, and the engine is a double for one reason -- the run it copies took
    five and a half minutes of clone -- so the double leaves the folder in the
    exact state that run measured
    (`widget-cancel-folder-after.txt`, 2026-09-05): a `.git`, upstream's own
    git-tracked `docker-compose.yml`, and no `.yulon-install.json`.

    That run passed 15 of 15 checks and still showed a modal saying two things
    that were not true of that folder. It said the source was there and to
    press "Use existing...", on the strength of a compose file the clone stage
    brings down with the source. And it said to press Install again to carry
    on, which was then driven and refused: "there is no record here of an
    install this app made"
    (`cycle2-pressA2-refused-existing-checkout.log`). A message that sends a
    user at a button the app then refuses is worse than no message, because
    the folder it tells them to keep is the reason for the refusal.

    **The first fix for that overshot, and this test held the overshoot.** It
    asserted no "Use existing..." half at all and a flat "Delete <dir>", on a
    folder that is `.git` plus an unmarked `docker-compose.yml` -- which is
    also what a bash-era install and a hand-written compose file look like, and
    `attach_existing()` adopts every one of them, because it gates on
    `compose_file()` and asks nothing about who wrote the file. `stat` cannot
    tell them apart. So the modal now says both readings and puts the condition
    to the user, and the delete it names is conditional on the user's own
    answer rather than an instruction (2026-09-05).

    THIS TEST ASSERTED THE HAZARD UNTIL 2026-09-02. It drove the whole path end

    `has_manifests`, `controller_view` builds an `Applier` rooted there, and
    `RunnerGit.clone()` `shutil.rmtree()`s a destination that exists and is not
    a git checkout, BEFORE contacting a remote -- and its closing assertions
    were `not victim.exists()` and `not clone.exists()`. A user file, gone, on a
    clone that had not yet been attempted.

    `apply._require_own_clone()` closed it (upstream PR #142, merged into this
    branch the same day), so the test now asserts the refusal it earned. The
    walk above is kept verbatim because it is the evidence for WHY the guard is
    at that spot: anything that reaches `install()` reaches a `rmtree` first.

    The strong assertion is that git was never invoked at all -- not that the
    file survived. A guard that let the clone start and merely put the folder
    back would satisfy "the file exists" and still have deleted it.

    Checked at the level of the code on 2026-09-02, on branch
    `fix/adoption-guard-fails-open` at fda035d: `yulon/git.py` `RunnerGit.clone`
    rmtrees `spec.dest` when `(spec.dest / ".git").is_dir()` is False and
    `spec.dest.exists()` is True; `yulon/apply.py` `Applier.clone_dir` returns
    `server_dir / CLONE_DIRS[type] / id`; `catalog.json` gives `wow-wotlk`
    `"has_manifests": true` and it is the only entry that has it;
    `yulon/ui/controller_view.py` passes that same `server_dir` to
    `wotlk_modules.applier()`.

    The only double ON THE CLONE PATH is `yulon.runner.run`, the subprocess seam,
    so the deletion, the paths and the ordering are all the shipping code's.

    Narrowed from a flat "the ONLY double here", which was false: `wsl.find_servers`
    is patched too (there is no other way to reach this code), and three autouse
    conftest fixtures are live, one of which suppresses modal dialogs. None of them
    touches the clone, so the conclusion stands - but a categorical claim that is
    not true is precisely what this branch was written to stop, and it should not
    appear in the test that carries the branch's own argument. The seam
    records whether the file was still there at the moment git was first asked
    to do anything, which is what "before it fetches anything" means.
