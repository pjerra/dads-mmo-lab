"""The enable press: writing the channel on, with the world stopped (8.2a).

The press is the risky half of this box, and its shape came out of the
adversarial review. The version before it probed that the port was free and then
wrote — check-then-act, with a window between the probe and the bind, and a bind
that can fail for reasons a probe cannot see. On the CMaNGOS trees that costs
`exit(-1)` with no character saves.

Requiring the world **stopped** removes the hazard instead of warning about it,
and it is smaller than the guard it replaced: the configuration is written while
the server is down, the user's ordinary Start brings it up through the staged
start Phase 7 already proved, and there is nothing running to interrupt.
