    `rename <char>` with no new name flags the rename for an ONLINE character
    (`Commands.cpp:12612-12623`); for an offline one the same spelling runs
    `UPDATE characters SET name = guid` (`:12624-12635`), throwing the name away
    and putting the numeric guid there. A button labelled "Rename at next login"
    that silently does that is data loss, so the entry carries a refusal and the
    tab draws it -- and, like the revive rule, it is the ENTRY's fact: WotLK,
    whose entry carries no such refusal, keeps its offline rename.
