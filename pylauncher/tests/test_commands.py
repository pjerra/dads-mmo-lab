"""Tests for `yulon.commands` — the text a command becomes (8.2a).

Pure. This module sends nothing and knows no container; it turns a template and
some arguments into one line, and refuses arguments the server would refuse.

The validators are the ones the prior art already derived from the bash oracle
(`rust-main:crates/dml-wow/src/soap_cmds.rs:24-40`, from
`cli/src/90-main.sh:116-138`), and the leading-dot rule is this project's answer
to an asymmetry that prior art shipped: `gm_level_cmd` emits `.character level`
WITH a dot and `gm_at_login_cmd` emits `character …` without, both pinned by
their own tests, and no comment explains why (`hypeer.md:1369-1374`).
