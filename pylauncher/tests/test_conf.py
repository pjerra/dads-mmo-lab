"""Tests for the ini conf patcher (`yulon.catalog.families.conf`).

Pure text in, pure text out, asserted byte for byte: a conf file is what the
emulator reads at boot, so "close enough" is a server that will not start.
The fixtures are shaped like the real `mangosd.conf.dist` / `realmd.conf.dist`
that ship in the CMaNGOS images, including the commented-out `SyncLevel` keys
the Vanilla installer's seds relied on uncommenting.

Two things here are about bytes rather than behaviour, and both are defects
this project has shipped in neighbouring modules already:

* **Line endings are the subject.** The real files disagree with each other:
  `mangosd.conf.dist.in` and `realmd.conf.dist.in` in `cmangos/mangos-classic`
  are LF, and `playerbot/aiplayerbot.conf.dist.in` in `cmangos/playerbots` is
  CRLF throughout (4862 of 4862 newlines, checked against the upstream file) —
  so ONE install patches both, and a patcher with one hard-coded newline mixes
  endings in whichever file it guessed wrong about. Every ending assertion here
  therefore encodes to UTF-8 and compares BYTES: `str` comparison would pass on
  the very substitution a bug introduces once the text has been through a
  `read_text()` anywhere, because that call translates `\\r\\n` to `\\n`.
* **A key has three states, not two** — absent, present-but-commented, and
  present-and-set — and each has its own test here, in both the
  `match_commented` and the default mood. A conf carrying both `# Foo = 1` and
  `Foo = 2` is a file nobody can reason about, so "found the comment, appended
  anyway" is asserted against explicitly.
