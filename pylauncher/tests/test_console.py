"""Tests for the WotLK console helper (`docker attach` over a pty) via a fake Popen.

The worldserver container runs with `tty: true`, so docker refuses to attach
unless its stdin is a terminal — the app therefore opens a pty and writes the
command to the master end (live-verified on Linux, 2026-08-21). Windows has no
pty, so `send_command()` refuses with an explanation instead of a raw docker
error; the transport tests below only run where a pty exists.

The parsing tests do not. Their fixtures are RECONSTRUCTED from the real
playerbots worldserver on yulon-ubuntu, 2026-08-23 — the live gate that found
what they pin (`console._parse_reply()`). The content is real; the line
terminators and the long `[mod-city-bots]` lines are abridged. They were
described here as "byte-exact captures" until a re-read of the container's own
log showed the real answer lines end `\r\r\n` where these end `\r\n`, and the
bot-log lines carry detail these drop (review, 2026-08-23). The difference is
inert to this parser — `rstrip("\r\n")` eats both — but "byte-exact capture" is
the phrase that licenses three unit tests to stand in for a live run nobody will
repeat, so it has to be true or gone.
