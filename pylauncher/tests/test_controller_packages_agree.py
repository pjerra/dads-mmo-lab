"""One question asked of all three CMaNGOS controller packages at once.

Every test file here is per-game, which is right for what each game does
differently and is exactly why a gap in ONE package survives: nobody reading
`test_controller_wow_tbc.py` is looking at Vanilla, so "Vanilla has this and TBC
does not" is invisible from inside either file. The defect that produced this
module was of that shape -- TBC alone had no `sql_for_install()`, while its
password plan (`generated`, `.db_password`) is identical to the two packages
that did, so a caller wanting a TBC account had no way to reach the password the
installer had minted.

So the rule here is comparative, and it is the only kind of test that can be:
these packages are peers, and a peer's absence is only visible against the
others. Where a game genuinely differs, the difference is named in the test
rather than being allowed to widen quietly.

    The tempting comparison is the call sites -- diff the keyword arguments each
    `_for_<game>()` passes -- and it answers the wrong question. `prompt`,
    `prompt_precedes_answer` and `scheme` are bound INSIDE each package's own
    `console`/`accounts` module, so the UI does not pass them; `import_probe`
    and `reset_unfinished` are AzerothCore-only, because a CMaNGOS install has
    no one-shot import service to re-run. A spelling diff reports all five as
    missing features. They are not.

    What the view actually depends on is `ControllerServices`: one field per
    operation the Server tab can perform. So every field is required to arrive
    for every game, with exactly one documented exception -- `store` and
    `applier` are the module surface, and a game has them only if the catalog
    says `has_manifests` and a `manifests/<game>/` tree exists for it. That was
    `wow-wotlk` alone until 8.7b added `wow-tbc`; for the two that still have
    none the pair is legitimately None, and `_no_manifest_store()` warns if the
    catalog ever says otherwise. The exception is keyed on the ENTRY rather
    than on a list of game ids here, so the next game to get manifests needs no
    edit in this file -- and cannot silently keep the exemption either.

    Enumerated from the dataclass rather than listed here, so a sixteenth
    capability added to the view cannot be wired for WotLK and forgotten for
    the rest.

    **This proves COMPLETENESS, not correctness, and the distinction is not
    pedantry.** `is not None` says a callable was bound; it never says the
    callable is THIS GAME'S. Swap Tortoise's console, backup and restore for
    Vanilla's and every assertion below still holds -- what catches that is the
    per-game work in `test_controller_view.py`, which drives each seam and reads
    the schema and container it addressed. So the sixteenth capability is
    required by this test to be present, and required by those tests to be the
    right one; neither half is the other, and a reader who takes this file for
    the whole answer will wire a game to its neighbour's database.
