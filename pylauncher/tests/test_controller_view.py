    other place that wires docker to a server, and it held two such call sites
    that six review passes walked straight past.

    Asked of the parse rather than of a spelling: which functions declare the
    parameter, and does each call supply it. A renamed helper stays covered.

    Locally-defined helpers are NOT exempt, and that is the point. The first
    version of this scan skipped any callee defined in this file, which
    exempted `_safe_bindings()` - a helper that takes `wsl_distro` and whose
    caller could forget it. The blocker shape reappeared one level up, inside
    the test written to prevent it (review, 2026-08-26). The cost is that such
    a call must NAME the parameter rather than pass it positionally, which is
    cheap and reads better at the call site anyway.

    DATACLASS FIELDS COUNT TOO, and they did not until 2026-08-31. The dunder
    skip below is right about `__init__` as a NAME, but a dataclass declares
    `wsl_distro` as an annotated class attribute and never writes an `__init__`
    at all - so `DockerSql(...)` and `DockerMysql(...)`, the two seams this
    function builds by hand, were invisible to a scan whose docstring promises
    the next seam cannot be forgotten. Measured: dropping `wsl_distro=` from
    either constructor left the whole suite at 1196 passed. A class whose body
    annotates the field is collected by its CLASS name, which is how the call
    site spells it.

    A MODULE-QUALIFIED CALL IS RESOLVED, AND ONLY WHERE IT RESOLVES. From 7.3
    `X.f()` is exempt when `X.py` defines `f` itself and that definition takes
    no distro - which is what keeps `networking.apply(plan, sql=sql)` out of the
    report. It is NOT exempt when `X` merely re-exports `f` from elsewhere: the
    first version of that rewrite skipped any name it could not find in `X`,
    which handed every re-exported seam a free pass the older bare-name scan
    would have caught. Dormant when found (no such call site existed), fixed
    anyway - see the regression test below.

# T73: who gets the height on the Modules tab.
#
# Measured live on 2026-09-16, maximised at 1920x1080: the module list showed
# about two and a half rows of forty while the report box and the rebuild log
# under it took the rest; reaching City Bots from the top took eleven
# page-downs. T44's approved mockup shows ten rows at once.
#
# EVERY measurement here is made with the theme applied and re-applied at the
# window's width, because that is the only way these numbers mean anything:
# `apply_dadcraft_theme(width=...)` regenerates the stylesheet at a font scale
# derived from the width (`main._Window._restyle_for_width`), and the fonts,
# paddings and `min-height`s it sets are most of what the tab spends. An
# unthemed window says the list has 42% and 5 rows where the themed one says
# 35% and 2 -- the first version of these tests measured the unthemed one and
# was wrong about every number in it.
#
# And through `main.build_catalog_tab()` -- the SAME function `build_window()`
# calls -- with the controller view added to the tab bar the way
# `build_window()` adds it, for the reason `test_catalog_view.py`'s width matrix
# does the same (T28 round 2): the tab bar's frame and the central widget's
# `QVBoxLayout` eat into the budget before a single row is measured.

    The defect this pins, measured on the shipped WotLK catalog before the chip
    order was changed: `battlepass` declares a client addon and requires
    `mod-ale`, so at this size it drew `needs the client folder` and put
    `needs AzerothCore Lua Engine (ALE), not installed` behind the overflow mark
    -- the one sentence saying why its Install is dead, in a tooltip a touch
    user has no way to open. `_chips_for()` now ranks the locks ahead of the
    other facts, so the lock is the last fact to go.

    The lock chip is found by its DETAIL matching `row.data.install_reason`,
    which is the sentence the applier would refuse with, rather than by
    re-spelling a label here: the chip and the refusal are meant to be the same
    words, and a test that spelled them itself would pass while they drifted.

    Two things were needed and the second is the one that finished it: the chip
    order alone still left `battlepass` drawing NOTHING at this size, because an
    even split between the row's text column and its status column gave the strip
    373px against a 341px lock chip plus the mark. The status column now takes
    two shares to the text column's one.

    width, measured before `_TabFit`'s coalescing timer.

    Asserted as ZERO at an unchanged size and at most one per step across the

    `_TabFit` folds the report for room and then answers the same way for as
    long as the width holds -- `set_room(False)` is a no-op when the answer has
    not changed -- so anything that shows the box behind its back stays shown.
    Until round 3 the strip's own handler did exactly that, and one click at
    960x600 with a refusal in the box drew the action bar at 76px of the 106 its
    two lines need, `Rebuild the server…` sliced through, and the custom-module
    card's label at 9px of 28.

    Either outcome is allowed and only one of them is asserted for, because the
    rule is about what must not happen: the box may stay folded (it does), or it
    may open with the list's floor giving the difference. What may not happen is
    the tab being cut. The click is a real mouse press on the strip, because the
    defect was in the handler that press reaches.

    The second half is the one that keeps this from passing for the wrong
    reason: the press must still be LIVE. A strip that had been made unclickable,
    or one that never folds at all, satisfies "nothing is cut" and is a
    different bug -- so the same press is made again at a width with the room,
    and there it opens.
