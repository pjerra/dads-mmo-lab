    that six review passes walked straight past.

    Asked of the parse rather than of a spelling: which functions declare the

    Locally-defined helpers are NOT exempt, and that is the point. The first
    version of this scan skipped any callee defined in this file, which
    exempted `_safe_bindings()` - a helper that takes `wsl_distro` and whose
    caller could forget it. The blocker shape reappeared one level up, inside
    the test written to prevent it (review, 2026-08-26). The cost is that such
