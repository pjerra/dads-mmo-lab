    """The guard for the test above, so the next seam added cannot be forgotten.

    Four blockers on this branch were one mistake wearing different clothes: a
    function that ACCEPTS `wsl_distro`, called from a site that does not PASS
    one. `Controller` has its own version of this scan. `for_wotlk()` is the
    other place that wires docker to a server, and it held two such call sites
    that six review passes walked straight past.

    Asked of the parse rather than of a spelling: which functions declare the
    parameter, and does each call supply it. A renamed helper stays covered.

    Locally-defined helpers are NOT exempt, and that is the point. The first
    version of this scan skipped any callee defined in this file, which
    exempted `_safe_bindings()` - a helper that takes `wsl_distro` and whose
    caller could forget it. The blocker shape reappeared one level up, inside
    the test written to prevent it (review, 2026-08-26). The cost is that such
    a call must NAME the parameter rather than pass it positionally, which is
    cheap and reads better at the call site anyway.

    DATACLASS FIELDS COUNT TOO, and they did not until 2026-08-31. The dunder
    skip below is right about `__init__` as a NAME, but a dataclass declares
    `wsl_distro` as an annotated class attribute and never writes an `__init__`
    at all - so `DockerSql(...)` and `DockerMysql(...)`, the two seams this
    function builds by hand, were invisible to a scan whose docstring promises
    the next seam cannot be forgotten. Measured: dropping `wsl_distro=` from
    either constructor left the whole suite at 1196 passed. A class whose body
    annotates the field is collected by its CLASS name, which is how the call
    site spells it.

    A MODULE-QUALIFIED CALL IS RESOLVED, AND ONLY WHERE IT RESOLVES. From 7.3
    `X.f()` is exempt when `X.py` defines `f` itself and that definition takes
    no distro - which is what keeps `networking.apply(plan, sql=sql)` out of the
    report. It is NOT exempt when `X` merely re-exports `f` from elsewhere: the
    first version of that rewrite skipped any name it could not find in `X`,
    which handed every re-exported seam a free pass the older bare-name scan
    would have caught. Dormant when found (no such call site existed), fixed
    anyway - see the regression test below.
