"""The TBC controller package: the facts it takes from `catalog.json`, and the one it refuses.

Nothing here needs Docker or a database. Every seam this package has —
`sql_query`, `exec_stdin`, the account `SqlSeam`, `MysqlDocker` — is handed a
fake, and the shared engines underneath (SRP6, the console parser, backup and
restore, `MarkerGate`'s five branches) are already pinned by
`test_accounts.py`, `test_console.py`, `test_maintenance.py` and
`test_sqlplan.py`. What is left to prove, and what these tests are about, is
that THIS game's values reach those engines instead of AzerothCore's: the
container names, the schema names, the database client, the ready marker, the
console prompt, the account scheme and the generated password.

The entry is loaded independently in this file rather than being read back out
of the package under test, so an assertion compares the package against
`catalog.json` and not against itself.

    The gap this closes was found by a live run, not by a test, and the shape of

    Backup button on TBC reported nothing missing. But `restore()` takes a
    safety dump of its own before it overwrites anything, and THAT call reached
    the shared `backup()` with no `core_databases`, so it fell back to
    `acore_auth, acore_characters, acore_world` and announced that a healthy
    CMaNGOS server was missing all three. Measured on m910q, 2026-09-04:

        WARNING [yulon.controller_wow_wotlk.maintenance] this install has no
        acore_auth, acore_characters, acore_world; backing up what it does

    It could not be fixed at the wrapper, which is the interesting part:
    `restore()` had no `core_databases` parameter at all, so there was nothing
    for a per-game wrapper to bind. The names had to be threaded through
    `restore()` and `_safety_backup()` first.

    Asserted on `missing_core` reaching a log, because that warning is the whole
    user-visible symptom: no dump is lost either way, and a person reading
    "this install has no acore_auth" on a TBC server has been told their server
    is broken when it is not.
