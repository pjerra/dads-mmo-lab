"""The credential file, and what has to be true before it exists (8.2a).

Two rules, and the first is the architecture's own for this module: **nothing is
persisted before a round trip has answered.** The second is that the file is
created private, proved on the flags `os.open` was given rather than on a
`chmod` afterwards — because a chmod is a second step, and the window before it
is exactly when a file is world-readable.
