"""Tests for `yulon.dashboard` — the one line above the three up/down words (8.1a).

The bug this exists to close, verbatim from `pyplan/bug-checklist.md:499`:

    HIGH — A TBC server whose mangosd is stuck in a restart loop is reported as
    a fully successful install, end to end through the GUI.

A crash-looping worldserver appears in `docker ps` between restarts, so every
check that asks "is it running" says yes. What separates the two is the restart
count and whether the current run has lasted.

    A watcher left running across 8.1d's crash-loop check went on calling a
    healthy server a loop for minutes after the world came back — zero restarts,
    and still a loop — while a dashboard made fresh at that moment read `up`.
    A count of zero cannot be a loop, and the sentence was simply false.

    But the count resetting is not proof of health either, and the first fix for
    this treated it as though it were (adversarial review, 2026-09-07). Docker
    resets `RestartCount` on a MANUAL start as readily as on a recreate — the
    live run measured `Container tortoise-mangosd Started`, not `Recreated`,
    with the count going 8 → 0 — so a user pressing Start on a server whose
    crash cause is still there would have been handed `stable=True` for as long
    as the world takes to load and die again, which on these trees is minutes.
    That is the bug 8.1a exists to close, arriving from the other side.

    So the reset moves only the LABEL. The interlock stays shut until this run
    has outlasted `SETTLED_AFTER`, which is the same evidence the settle rule
    has always asked for, now measured from the run that is actually going.
