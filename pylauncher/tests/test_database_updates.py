"""The button that applies an install plan's re-runnable phases to a server that exists.

T11 made the route: a phase declared `rerun_on_marked` is applied by `_import`
to an install the probe already reads as finished, before the world starts, with
no marker written. Its reviewer then found the route had no way in for a GUI
user — the catalog tile greys to "Installed" once the app knows the folder, and
`rebuild_stages()` excludes `import` on purpose — so for an established Tortoise
install the sentence that opened T11 was still true: no button in the app
applies those three files, and the only caller was the CLI harness.

This file is about the second route. `update_stages()` is the database started
alone and the import stage, and nothing else — no `up`, no compile, no compose
regeneration — and `update_databases()` refuses before any of it while the world
server is up or unreadable, because the route writes DDL into the character
database and a running worldserver holds that database in memory and saves it
back over whatever it finds (owner answer 7, checklist 8.7a).

The second precondition is the one round 1 did not have, and it is the larger
half. `import` is the family's own stage and the flagged-phase route is ONE arm
of a five-branch table: `absent` runs the whole plan and writes a completion
marker, `partial` drops every schema the plan names first. A press that consented
to a named list of files must reach neither, so `ctx.updates_only` is read before
`stage_import()` is called at all and the ordinary import is unreachable on this
route rather than guarded on it.

What is unit-tested only: no press was run on a box for this change. The live
half is `pyplan/gates/tortoise-updates-button-m910q-2026-09-09/`, and until it
exists the m910q evidence for this route is T11's, through the CLI harness.

    """T19's whole point, end to end, over a database that remembers what was written.

    The install is the owner's: every schema the plan names, characters and
    accounts in them, and no `yulon_install` table anywhere. T14's button
    refuses it — `populated`, and `import_reads_as_finished()` is False — which
    is the fact this ticket was filed on. The adopt press writes the row; the
    same databases then read `imported` through the SAME real `MarkerGate`; and
    the updates press applies the flagged phase, which is the thing no button in
    the app could do for this install before.

    The gate is a real `sqlplan.MarkerGate` over the fake server rather than a
    canned answer, because the claim is that the row WRITTEN is the row READ:
    a probe answering from a list would pass this test with the writer deleted.

    Catches the marker written with a hash the gate does not recognise, written
    into a schema the gate does not look in, and a `CREATE TABLE` the probe's
    `information_schema` reading cannot then see.
