"""T98: the database outlives the world server on every stop path, not only the app's.

Measured on yulon-ubuntu (2026-09-23): the app's Stop (`compose stop -t 300`) walks `depends_on`
and stops the database last, but a Docker DAEMON shutdown — a PC shutdown, a Docker Desktop quit,
`systemctl stop docker` — signals every container at once. MariaDB was gone 1.8 s later while the
world was still draining its save queue: 0 saves landed, 9 failed. On a Tortoise install made before
T107 most character tables are MyISAM, so a save cut between its DELETE and its INSERT leaves a
character without those rows; a fresh install converts them to InnoDB (T107), where a cut save is
rolled back whole, but the saves still queued when the database goes are lost on either engine.

So the database service's entrypoint holds SIGTERM while a server container is still connected and
only then shuts the database down, and its `stop_grace_period` is long enough for that wait. These
tests run the RENDERED script (compose's `$$` unescaped, exactly what the container's bash gets)
with the image's entrypoint and SQL client stubbed, which is the real path minus the database.
