"""Tests for `yulon.dbreads` — how many players and how many bots (8.1a).

Two incidents recorded in `pyplan/phase8-reads/hypeer.md` decide almost every
rule here, and both are about a detector failing in a direction that looks fine:

* Asking only the playerbots registry fails **open**. On a freshly built install
  that registry can be empty while a thousand bot characters play, so
  `account NOT IN (<empty set>)` is true for every row and every bot is counted
  as a person (`botid.rs:4-17`, live proof 2026-08-01).
* An empty account prefix compiles to `LIKE '%'` and fails the other way: every
  account is a bot (`botid.rs:33-38`).

So the clause has two arms, and a prefix that cannot be read is refused rather
than defaulted, guessed or blanked.
