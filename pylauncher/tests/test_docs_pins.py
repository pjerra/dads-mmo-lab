    """Every test name a page presents as EXISTING — which is not every name it spells.

    The rule this guard enforces is "a reader who follows this citation finds the
    test". A page that says a test was deleted is not making that promise: it is
    recording history, and the reader who follows it finds exactly what the page
    told them to expect.

    Holding those to the same rule turns this guard into the opposite of what it
    is for. 7.3's plan instructs a task to DELETE two named tests, records a
    deleted module, and carries one code block for a test that was specified and
    never written. Under a blind scan the only way to make a ticked phase pass is
    to repoint those names at live tests — which would make the plan say that
    F.4 deleted a test that is alive today. A guard whose remedy is to falsify
    the record is a guard that gets deleted.

    So a name is exempt when the LINE THAT SPELLS IT also says it is gone. Line
    scope and not paragraph, because a paragraph that mentions a deletion
    anywhere would exempt every name in it.

    WHAT THIS GIVES UP, said here rather than discovered later: a page can now
    write "F.4 deletes `test_x`" about a test that is alive, and this guard will
    not catch it. That hole is real, and it is narrow: the claim has to sit within
    `_GONE_WINDOW` characters of the name -- not merely somewhere on the same
    line, which is what this said until a review pointed out that two citations
    can share a line -- and it has to be a claim of removal. The alternative was a
    guard that a phase tick converts into an instruction to rewrite history,
    which is the worse failure.

    """A document that cites a test by name acquires a dependency nothing enforced.

    Written 2026-09-02 after the third instance in one night. A doc on this branch
    cited `test_every_shipped_entry_is_installable_somewhere_and_names_its_family`
    an hour before a review renamed it; K.7 cited
    `test_every_stage_before_the_build_that_writes_into_the_build_context`, which
    has never existed; and a plan instructed an implementer not to touch
    style-guide rows that do not exist either.

    The two pins above check that the CLAIMS match the code. They say nothing
    about whether the citations resolve, which is a different failure and the more
    embarrassing one: a reader who follows a dead citation concludes the property
    is untested, and a reader who follows a renamed one lands somewhere else
    entirely.

    Scoped to the pages 7.2 owns, PLUS every phase plan whose checklist box is
    ticked — read off `checklist.md` here rather than listed, so nobody has to
    remember to add one. A plan cites tests it intends a future task to WRITE, so
    a dead citation there is a forward reference while the phase is open and a
    claim about the tree once it closes. The tick is what flips it.

    Measured 2026-09-02 at `f6ed1b9a`, when 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3 were all still
    unticked and so all still out of scope: `7.1-spine-azerothcore-linux.md` had
    13 of 141 cited names unresolved, `7.2-retire-bash.md` 27 of 70, and
    `7.3-cmangos-family.md` 41 of 224. Most are in-flight renames rather than
    aspirations, so ticking a box will cost a cleanup pass — which is the point.

    Widening to all of `pyplan/` instead does NOT reduce to "the plans are the
    problem". On the same measurement, `pyplan/` with the plans excluded still
    had unresolved names: `checklist.md` 5, `bug-checklist.md` 3 and
    `phase7-decisions.md` 2. Those three are dated records of what a run said on
    a day, and a test deleted afterwards is a different failure from a citation
    that never resolved; they are left out until someone decides which rule they
    are under, not because they are clean.
