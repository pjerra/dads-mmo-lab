"""Tests for the verified installer download in `yulon.platform`, and for the TLS
rules the whole package has to keep.

Almost nothing here opens a socket: the curl transport is exercised through the
`run` seam, the in-process transport through an `open_url` seam that returns
canned responses, and the three small GETs through a stand-in `urlopen`. The
assertions are about the thing that actually broke on a real Windows 11 box
(2026-08-22) — `urllib` could not verify desktop.docker.com because OpenSSL
cannot see the roots Windows fetches on demand — and about the two rules that
came out of it: a transfer that cannot be verified fails loudly rather than
retrying with verification off, and no module in the package calls `urlopen`
without a verifying context. The second rule is here rather than in a file of its
own because it is the same measurement that motivates the first.

The exception is the last section, which stands up a real self-signed HTTPS
server on 127.0.0.1 (review finding, 2026-08-23). Building the failure by hand is
what let a defect through: every "verification" test constructed the exception
itself, so nobody noticed that `urlopen` never raises the one the code was
looking for. One test has to earn its answer from the real stack.

    `platform.sys` IS the `sys` module, so setting `sys.platform` to "win32"
    changes it for every module in the process — including `shutil`, whose
    `which()` then takes its win32 branch and calls
    `_winapi.NeedCurrentDirectoryForExePath`. On Linux `_winapi` is None, so that
    raises AttributeError from inside the stdlib and the test dies somewhere it
    never meant to go.

    This stayed invisible for a reason worth recording: `_win_path_needs_curdir`
    did not exist before Python 3.12, and CI pinned 3.11 — so the suite passed
    there and failed on any box running a 3.12+ interpreter, which
    `pyplan/README.md` §2 supports and says so. Measured on Ubuntu 24.04 /
    Python 3.12.3, 2026-08-23; the CI matrix now covers a second version so this
    class of thing cannot hide the same way again.

    Stubbing `platform._which` — the single seam over `shutil.which` — is what
    keeps the fake inside the module under test.

    `_windows_docker_bins` is stubbed for a second, independent reason found the
    same day: `_windows_docker_programs()` stats the real filesystem for
    `docker.exe` no matter what `which` seam `ensure_docker()` was handed, so on
    a Windows box that HAS Docker these tests resolved an absolute path, the
    canned `run` stopped recognising `["docker", "info"]`, and `ensure_docker()`
    returned "daemon already reachable" before reaching the code under test.
    They passed only because `docker` also happened to be on the developer's
    PATH. "Pretend this is Windows" has to mean a Windows box with nothing
    installed on it, or the assertion is about the host rather than the code.
