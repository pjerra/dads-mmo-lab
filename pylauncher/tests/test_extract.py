"""Tests for `yulon.catalog.families.extract`.

The rule under test is three-part and every part is a real incident shape: a
tool killed after it passed its count threshold (record missing → re-run), a
resume pointed at another client (stage facts differ → everything re-runs),
and an edited argv (hash differs → that tool re-runs).

The fourth thing these tests pin is the shape of the answer, not its value.
"Has this tool already run?" has three states and `tool_satisfied` returns two,
so every way of not knowing — an evidence file that will not open, one that
will not parse, a `stat()` on the client that raises — has to be walked to the
`False` side on purpose and proved to land there. A skip is unrecoverable from
the user's side: they get a half-extracted client that looks finished. A
needless re-run only costs an hour.

    The FIRST case here is the only one the world produces, and for a round it
    was the one nothing drove. `vmap_extractor` stats `Buildings/dir` and
    `Buildings/dir_bin` and writes only the second — appended from its first
    tile (`adtfile.cpp:118`, `wdtfile.cpp:51`), while `dir` has no writer under
    `contrib` at either pinned revision. Every real `Buildings/` on m910q
    (`~/tbc-7.4c`, `~/vanilla-75b`, `~/vanilla-75`) holds `dir_bin` and no
    `dir`, so a refusal that listed both would send every real user looking for
    a file that is not there.

    The second case is the one the tool's OR still allows and nothing writes: a
    folder that holds a `dir` as well. It is driven because the guard mirrors
    the tool's condition rather than the tool's output, and a `dir` that
    arrives from anywhere at all is refused by the real binary too.

    The `dir`-ALONE case asks `blocking_output()` and not only
    `blocked_message()`, and that is the sixth pass's correction. Until then
    the third case called the message builder directly, which lists whatever
    is present without ever asking whether the guard fires — so narrowing
    `blocking_output()` to `(folder / DIR_BIN).exists()` survived the whole

# thing about their own machine.
#
# The retry: no rule matched (a plain failure, and nothing in the log mentions a
# retry at all), the rule matched and the second attempt worked (the log names
# which tools ran again and why), or the rule matched and the second attempt
# failed too (a refusal that says it was ALREADY the retry, so the same crash
# twice does not read as the first one).
#
# The farm: it was not needed, it was built and the tool ran inside it, or it
# could not be built — which is emphatically not "the tool failed", because the
# tool never started. `STAGE_SCRIPT` says so in its own words and with its own
# status, and both halves are demanded before that sentence is used, exactly as
# `docker.cli_missing_run()` demands both halves of its sentinel.

    the named tools again" reaches the EXTRACTOR first, and would empty a
    `Buildings` that is complete and correct and spend half an hour rebuilding

    It is not a free trade, and an earlier draft of this test said it was. That

    nothing extra -- which is false, and the run on m910q is what shows it: the

    `Your output directory seems to be polluted`. Before any of this existed the

# is asked of `run_plan`:
#
#   * WHAT is removed — the answer has to be a folder this app made, under the

#   * WHETHER the removal is followed by a run — a wipe and then a cancel, a
#     missing docker CLI or a crash leaves the user with less than they had,
#     and every one of those endings has to say so;
#   * WHICH part of the skip rule can actually refuse. `run_mmaps` hands
#     `satisfied()` the SAME evidence on both sides, so `same_stage()`'s four
#     fields agree by construction; the parts that can disagree are the
#     `client_facts_complete` veto, the record for this argv, and the counts.

    """The wipe's inputs, audited where they are CHOSEN rather than where they meet.

    PR #142's shape was a uniqueness claim that protected nothing because the
    caller reaching `rmtree` never asked it. The equivalent here is asserting
    "it removed `data/mmaps`" on one happy path and calling the question
    settled — a later `MmapPlan` field naming its own output folder would pass
    that assertion on the day it was written and point the removal somewhere
    else on the day it shipped.

    So the two inputs are pinned instead of the one result. `data_dir` is the
    only path `run_mmaps` is given — there is no client parameter to confuse it
    with — and `MMAPS_DIR` is a bare relative component with no anchor and no
    `..`, so `data_dir / MMAPS_DIR` cannot leave `data_dir` however either is
    spelled. `MmapPlan` carrying no folder field is the third leg: no catalog
    entry has anywhere to write a different name.

    The field set is pinned rather than a `"folder" not in` check on purpose:
    the question is not whether today's spelling of a folder field is absent,
    it is whether ANY new field slipped in without someone asking it.
    `success_codes` was added on 2026-09-03 and answers it -- a tuple of exit

    `tool_satisfied` ends `return not shortfall(produces, data_dir)`, so a

    and whose `produces` folder is short answers False, and would answer True
    later in the same press if an earlier tool in the loop filled that folder.
    The pre-pass asks its question before any of them runs, so its set and the
    loop's set agree only while no tool can fill another's `produces`.

    In the three shipped plans they cannot, and that is a fact about
    `catalog.json` rather than about this module -- {dbc, maps}, {Buildings},
    {vmaps}, disjoint per entry -- which is why the comment beside the pre-pass
    names this test rather than resting on the claim. A fourth tool sharing a folder
