"""T303: a Stop during an extraction starts no further tool and ends the tool's container.

Seen on yulon-win11 2026-10-05 (`.notes/gates/live-308-307-yulon-win11-2026-10-05`,
~13:55Z): Stop was pressed in "Re-extract map data" while the client packs were
being laid into the temporary copy. The packs went on for 37 s, then mapextractor
started in an unnamed `docker run --rm` container writing into the server's
`data/`, the run said "--- cancelled", and the container went on extracting until
it was removed by hand.

The docker CLI here is `support_fake_docker`'s: its container is a file that
outlives the CLI, exactly as Docker Desktop's does, and only `rm -f <name>`
ends it.
