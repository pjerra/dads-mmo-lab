"""Tests for the AzerothCore family (`yulon.catalog.families.azerothcore`, roadmap 7.1).

The tests of `test_native.py` (roadmap 6.2), re-homed unchanged in intent when
the engine split into a game-free spine and a family: every one of them is
about WHAT the WotLK install does — its stages, its refusals, what a resume
repeats — and that is the family's contract. Spine-only behaviour is in
`test_spine.py`; the machine double is `tests/support_native.py`.

Every external effect is a seam, so a whole install runs here in milliseconds
with no daemon, no network and no four-hour build. Nothing below is evidence
that the engine installs a server — it is evidence about the engine's control
flow, its refusals, and what a resume does and does not repeat.

The platform is always injected through the `platform_id` seam. Faking
`sys.platform` instead mutates the real module for the whole process, which is
how this suite once went red on every Python 3.12+ Linux box while CI stayed
green (checklist, "CI was green while the suite was red").

    """The registry as it stood before K.8: `azerothcore` and nothing else.

    The test below is about what `installer_for()` does when a shipped entry
    names a family THIS BUILD has no engine for. That was the tree's real state
    for the four groups between G.4 (which landed the three CMaNGOS `native`
    blocks) and K.8 (which registered the class that reads them), and `wow-tbc`
    was the live example. K.8 registered it, and the example went away; the
    state did not, because the next lineage's catalog data will arrive ahead of
    its engine the same way. What F.3 changed is the ANSWER: it used to be a
    fallback to the entry's bash script, and it is now a refusal.

    Narrowing the REGISTRY rather than editing an entry is what keeps the
    fixture honest about which rule it violates: `NativeInstall.family` is a
    `Literal["azerothcore", "cmangos"]`, so an entry naming a third family is a
    state no `catalog.json` can reach, and a test built on one would be
    proving the branch against data the app cannot receive.

    Two functions disagreed about what owning a folder means, and a corrupt file
    landed between them. `read_state()` answered `None` for a state file that
    would not parse, so `_guard()` treated the folder as FRESH and skipped every
    refusal it has; `claimed_this_folder()` answered
    `(server_dir / STATE_FILE).is_file()` — presence — so
    `refuse_unowned_checkout()` called the folder OURS and stood down; and
    `git fetch` + `git reset --hard FETCH_HEAD` ran over a user's own checkout.

    The repro is the adversarial reviewer's, and it needs no SELinux and no
    resume: clone the repo to `~/mywork`, edit a file, truncate
    `.yulon-install.json` to zero bytes, install into `~/mywork`. Commit
    `60d53374` hid this on enforcing boxes — the container could not read `.git`
    at all, so an earlier guard raised first — and `5c6c655c`, which made those
    reads work again, uncovered it.

    the way Fedora 44 Enforcing was measured to behave (2026-08-30): a bind

    written before stage one survives every later stage's failure, because no
    later `dest` is the server dir (`clone-modules` writes under `modules/`).
    `test_a_death_that_runs_no_except_block_still_leaves_the_folder_claimed`
    holds that half, and
    `test_the_folder_is_claimed_before_the_first_stage_writes_a_single_byte`
    holds the write itself. What it did NOT buy is the failure that produced it
    — the TBC-on-Windows gate killed mid-clone on `yulon-win11` (2026-09-03) is
    a `clone-core` death — and that is what is pinned here, as a defect rather
    than a design, so a fix has a red test to turn green.

    A fix has to change the clone, not the claim: `git clone <url> <dir>`
    refuses a directory that is not empty, which is why the seam empties it, so
    any record living inside the server dir is unreachable to stage one. Not
    attempted from this lane — it moves `yulon/git.py` and needs a live gate —
    so what is recorded here is the measured shape of the hole.

    The user-facing consequence is the last assertion: the folder this leaves
    is the one `cancelled_install_message()` must not send back to Install.

    """The half the ownership record does NOT buy back, measured rather than assumed.

    `_claim_before_writing()` teaches `_guard()` that the folder is this
    install's. It teaches `stage_clone_sources()` nothing: that stage asks a
    different question — is there a `.git` here — and a destination with files
    and no `.git` is refused, because the clone seam `shutil.rmtree`s a
    destination it does not recognise and a tree somebody unpacked by hand must
    not fall through (review, 2026-08-23).

    **And for `clone-core` the record is not there to consult anyway.** This
    test asserted `STATE_FILE` was still on disk after the death, and passed
    only because `write_then_die()` skipped the `shutil.rmtree` the real seams
    open with (`as_the_clone_seam_does()`, m910q 2026-09-05). With it in, the
    claim is gone before the double writes a byte, and the retry's refusal is
    the FIRST one after all — "is not empty and was not created by this app",
    from `_claim_folder()`, one step earlier than the narrower sentence this
    test used to end on.

    So the second refusal this test was written to record is not what a
    `clone-core` death produces; it is what a death in any LATER stage with a
    non-git destination produces, where the record does survive. Both endings
    are asserted below, from the same double, so neither can be read as the
    other.

    The two guards disagreeing about who owns the folder is bug §38's open
    design question, and the answer is the owner's: ownership recorded before
    the first mutating stage would let the clone stage consult it, which is a
    change across the spine and the families rather than a patch.
