"""Tests for the CMaNGOS family engine (`yulon.catalog.families.cmangos`, phase 7.3).

Same shape as `test_families_azerothcore.py`: the `Recorder` machine double from
`tests/support_native.py`, the real `wow-tbc` catalog entry, the real shared
templates. Nothing here proves a CMaNGOS server installs — that is gate 7.4 —
it proves the family's control flow, its refusals, what a resume repeats, and
that every `docker run` it asks for is shaped the way the design says (client
`:ro`, `--user` on Linux, cwd `/out`), asserted by FIELD on `ContainerRun`.

The import gate here is a `CallableGate` over `Recorder.probe`/`Recorder.reset`:
`MarkerGate`'s five branches belong to `test_sqlplan.py`, and this file proves
the family's reaction to each answer. K.7 bound the `import` stage and added
`CmangosInstaller._gate`; `engine()` attaches the pair as `_test_gate`, and the
autouse `gated` fixture patches `_gate` to hand it back, with `raising=True`.
What that keyword buys — and what stood in for it while no `_gate` existed — is
recorded in that fixture's own docstring rather than up here, because this
paragraph went on saying the seam "is not wired yet and cannot be" after K.7 had
wired it, and cited a test that has never existed. A module docstring is the
first thing read and the last thing re-checked.

    """M15 and M-R2, killed at the THREE roads listed below — and covering no others.

    Mutation M15 (2026-09-01) added a second secret key to the single
    `_tokens()` mapping — `"ROOT_PASSWORD": ctx.secrets.db_password` — and a
    planted template spelling `{{ROOT_PASSWORD}}` rendered
    `ENV ROOT_PASSWORD=tbc-0123456789abcdef` into the Dockerfile while all
    1872 tests passed — the whole suite as it stood that day, recorded at
    `9e198c05`; it is 1974 at `f6ed1b9a`, so read the number as a date and not
    as a size. `dockerfile.render()` drops one KEY BY NAME, so the
    second name walked past it, and no test in the suite looked at the mapping
    as a whole.

    So this one does, and it names no token: it puts a distinct sentinel in
    every field of `Secrets`, spies on the mapping the stage actually hands
    `render()`, and asserts no sentinel is anywhere in it — as a value or
    inside one.

    **The roads, and the mutation that put each one here.** `_public_tokens()`
    is handed a `server_dir`, so `ctx.secrets` is not the only place a password
    can be reached from: whatever the earlier stages have already written into
    that directory is in reach too. The sentinel therefore goes into each of
    these before the stage runs.

    * `ctx.secrets` itself — M15, above.
    * The file `install.password` names, which K.3's `db-password` stage writes
      two stages before the build. `resolve_secrets(server_dir)` is a public
      inherited method taking exactly the argument this body already holds, and
      by that point it READS that file rather than minting. A mutation taking
      that route walked past the `ctx.secrets`-only version of this test with
      the whole suite green (measured 2026-09-02).
    * `<server_dir>/.env` — mutation M-R2, measured 2026-09-02. K.4's
      `generate-compose` stage merges `DB_ROOT_PASSWORD=<the plaintext
      password>` into that file, and it runs at `STAGE_NAMES` index 3, ONE
      stage before `build` at index 4. A seven-line helper reading it, with no
      public method and no cache anywhere, put that value under
      `"ROOT_PASSWORD"`, rendered `ENV ROOT_PASSWORD=tbc-0123456789abcdef` into
      a Dockerfile, and left the suite at 1889 passed, 3 skipped (2026-09-02,
      recorded at `e176af17`) with mypy, ruff and black clean. The `.env` below
      is written by RUNNING the real
      `generate-compose` stage rather than by spelling its key out here, so a
      renamed key or file follows it; the assertion that the sentinel reached
      the file is what keeps that from going quietly vacuous.

    **What it still does not catch, said out loud so the name is not read as
    more than it is.** The set covered is one context and two files, not "the
    server dir". A mutation reading some OTHER file under `server_dir` that a
    stage writes a password into is uncovered. So is one that resolves the
    password ONCE and caches it — on the class, in a module global, anywhere
    outside this call — because a cached value can have come from an earlier
    `server_dir` that no sentinel here ever occupied; that variant was measured
    surviving on 2026-09-02. `_public_tokens()`'s docstring records why no test
    in this shape can close the set, and the guarantee against a NAMED secret
    remains `dockerfile.SECRET_TOKENS`' key-drop and refusal, which run
    whatever the mapping holds.

    The other half of M15's lesson. Covering the name `DB_PASSWORD` is what
    failed; the fix derives the secret token names from the fields of the
    `Secrets` instance, so the derivation has to be shown to answer for a
    field that did not exist when it was written. A subclass is how a second
    secret is added here without editing `yulon/catalog/native.py`, and
    `secret_token_map()` asks `fields()` of the INSTANCE for exactly that
    reason.

    **The line this test used to end on was not a guard.** It read
    `assert "API_TOKEN" not in eng._public_tokens(server_dir)`, and `API_TOKEN`
    exists only on the local subclass below — which `_public_tokens()` is never
    handed, since it takes a `server_dir` and no context. No edit to that
    method's body could fail it short of literally spelling `API_TOKEN`; undoing
    the split makes it raise `AttributeError`, which is a claim about a
    DECLARATION and not about a value. It is replaced by the enumeration below,
    which is this test's actual subject: the keys `_secret_tokens()` adds on top
    of the public half are exactly the ones the derivation predicts from the
    fields of the secret handed in — no fewer (a dropped field), no more (a
    listed name), and spelled the one way.

    Measured 2026-09-02, and corrected the same day. The first version of this
    note said an extra undeclared key was caught here but that
    `test_both_token_mappings_carry_the_family_set_from_catalog_data` caught it
    too, and that "no mutation was found that this line alone kills". A review
    found one, and it is exactly the shape this test exists for: a key added
    only when the secret carries more fields than `native.Secrets` declares —

        if len(fields(ctx.secrets)) > 1:
            secret = {**secret, "UNDECLARED_EXTRA": "x"}

    — is invisible to every test that builds a real `native.Secrets`, because
    for one the branch never runs. Reproduced 2026-09-02: with that edit in
    `_secret_tokens()` the suite came back `1 failed, 1888 passed, 3 skipped`
    (recorded at `e176af17`; the baseline was 1889 that day and is 1974 at
    `f6ed1b9a`) and the one failure was this test. So the enumeration below is not
    redundant with the other: it reaches a field that exists only on a
    subclass, and that reach is what caught this.

    Whether a secret VALUE can reach the public mapping is a different question
    with a different answer, and it belongs to
    `test_neither_the_context_secrets_nor_the_password_on_disk_reaches_the_rendered_mapping`

    stage wrote.

    Two roads into the context, both asserted below as values on disk:

    * `db-password` runs before `build` and puts the plaintext password at the
      ROOT of the server dir, which is the directory `docker build` is pointed

    `db-password` writes the plaintext password into the server dir two stages
    before the build (the test above), so the file is inside the build context
    on disk. What keeps it out of the tarball `docker build` streams to the
    daemon is one character in each shipped `dockerignore.tmpl`: the `*` that
    excludes everything, before the `!src/...` line re-includes the core tree.

    Nothing tested that. A `!` re-include added below those lines — the shape
    of edit somebody makes to get one more file into a build — would ship the
    password into an image layer with the whole suite green, and an image layer
    is the expensive kind of leak: `docker history` prints it long after the
    file is deleted.

    Rendered through the real `dockerfile.render()` and the real
    `_public_tokens()`, not read as a template, because it is the RENDERED text
    the daemon reads; and asked about the file the ENTRY names rather than a
    literal `.db_password`, so a catalog that renamed it is answered about the
    file it actually writes.

    **What was measured about its overlap, and about its limit, 2026-09-02.**
    `test_composegen.py`'s
    `test_every_cmangos_dockerignore_admits_only_the_core_tree_it_copies`
    arrived with `yulon-phase7` and pins the SHAPE — first line `*`, exactly one
    `!` line, and it names the core tree. Three mutations were run against the
    pair:

    * the leading `*` deleted — both go red.
    * `!.db_password` appended — both go red.
    * `!etc` appended to `wow-tbc/native/dockerignore.tmpl` — the shape test
      goes red for `wow-tbc`; THIS test stays green on all three
      parametrisations.

    The third is the honest limit and is written down rather than left for a
    reader to infer coverage this test does not have. `dockerignore_excludes()`
    answers for a name at the ROOT of the context and has no parent-directory
    walk, so the password-bearing `.conf` files `conf` writes under `etc/` are
    outside what it can be asked about. Nothing on this branch asserts that
    `etc/*.conf` stays out of the build context; what stands there is the shape
    test's refusal of a second `!` line plus Docker's own rule that an excluded
    directory takes its children with it.

    The two are kept apart because they answer to different owners: that one is
    about which SOURCE TREE reaches the daemon — its whole docstring is about
    `src/tbc-db` and `.git` — so a legitimate build change needing a second `!`
    line will be argued with by editing its assertions, and after that edit
    nothing would be left saying the PASSWORD must not go. This test names the
    password, derives it from `install.password`, and has to be argued with

    not hypothetical — the compose templates for all three CMaNGOS games live
    there, and `NativeInstall.dockerfile_dir` is an unvalidated `str | None`. So
    the walk is now the whole installers tree rather than one directory shape;
    `test_a_dockerfile_template_the_glob_cannot_see_still_cannot_bake_the_secret`

    (`STAGE_NAMES` index 1) has already written the plaintext into that folder by the

    mints — it reads the install's real secret off disk. Run here, not described, and the

    `carries_a_secret()` fires on a key this app puts in the mapping itself, `render()`
    refuses, and nothing has leaked. Measured on m910q 2026-09-05 over the three shipped
    `_public_tokens()` mappings: 1046 distinct password strings do this (1031 by
    containment over the 19 values at or above the floor, 15 by equality below it),
    `characters`, `tw_logon`, `vanilla-` and `/opt/mangos` among them.

    That surface is the same before and after this test existed — the rule is not narrowed

    under its declared token", about `DB_IMAGE`, which the user did not write and cannot
    drop, while the remedy in their hands — their own password — went unnamed. So the
    assertions here are about the remedy: the file is named with its full path, the words
    it is offered in, and the cost of changing it (the database volume).

    The two wording assertions below are here because `9bff3e81` rewrote that sentence and
    left it held by nothing: measured on m910q 2026-09-05, reverting it to
    "changing that password is the only thing that clears this … was created with the
    current password" kept all 213 tests in the two files green.

    press 1 refused with "use “Stop and remove containers…” on the Server tab,
    delete .../srv, and install it again"; the containers went (no `-v` --
    `docker.remove_staged()` keeps the volume by design) and so did the folder,
    taking `.db_password` with it, since that file lives inside it; the volume
    `yulon-wow-tbc-ffb3ef7e_db-data` was still there, and `install_id()`
    hashes the ABSOLUTE path, so the reinstall came back to the same volume
    name (ffb3ef7e before and after the `rmtree`); press 2 stopped at
    `_db_password` -- "that database cannot be opened again: `docker volume rm
    ...` deletes it, and every character in it". `_db_password`'s own docstring
    had already refused to send anyone round that loop.

    2026-09-05) and the reason this test is not the one it was: taking away the
    image and the evidence file re-ran the extraction over a `data/Buildings`
    the first extraction had filled, and `vmap_extractor` refuses to start when
    that folder holds `dir` or `dir_bin` -- so the press bought a recompile and
    then died at "Your output directory seems to be polluted, please use an
    empty directory!", with the re-created evidence recording `dbc and maps`
    alone so every later press died there too. This test could not see it,
    because the double it drives fabricated anonymous files and never those
    two. It writes them now (`support_native.Recorder.run_container`) and
    refuses on them, which is what makes the run below a measurement rather
    than a restatement.

    What is asserted here is the whole of the replacement: everything the
    sentence names is taken away and nothing else is, and the next press

    """`run_mmaps` deletes `data/mmaps`; this is the call site that keeps the client away from it.

    Three legs held the guarantee inside `extract.py` before anything called
    it: `run_mmaps`'s signature takes no client path, `MMAPS_DIR` is a single
    relative component, and `MmapPlan` carries no folder field. This engine is
    the first caller, and the leg it owns is the one that cannot be seen by
    reading the call — `data_dir=ctx.server_dir / DATA_DIR` and
    `data_dir=ctx.client_dir` are the same shape on the page, and the second
    would hand `shutil.rmtree` a folder inside somebody's game install.

    So the spec is audited by field rather than by eye — and the fields are
    ENUMERATED off `ContainerRun` rather than listed here. Until 2026-09-01
    they were listed: argv, the env VALUES, workdir, image, plus the mounts,
    five of the eight. This mutant, in `_mmaps`, passed that audit:

        user_args = (*self._user_args(), "-v", f"{ctx.client_dir}:/client:ro")

    It hands the mmaps container the user's client as a real bind. Measured
    that day on `yulon-ubuntu`: run alone, this test reported `1 passed`; the
    file went red only at `test_mmaps_runs_the_generator_over_data_and_records_it`,
    which pins `run.user_args` for its own unrelated reason. A guarantee a
    neighbour happens to hold is not held by the test named for it, so the
    walk now covers `user_args`, `ulimits`, `security_args` and env KEYS, and a
    ninth field on the day it is added.

    The `ctx` handed to `_mmaps` here DOES carry a client dir, deliberately — a
    body that reached for `ctx.client_dir` would find one rather than a `None`
    that fails for a different reason — and the client sits beside the server
    dir under `tmp_path`, so neither is an ancestor of the other.

    Both spellings of the client path are looked for, because a body that said
    `ctx.client_dir.resolve()` would otherwise slip through wherever `tmp_path`
    is reached by a link.

    An `is_relative_to(client)` leg over the mounts stood here until
    2026-09-01 and was REMOVED rather than repaired. It was lexical, so a `..`
    component or a symlinked `data/` walked past it; and made non-lexical with
    `.resolve()` it still could not fail under this fixture, because the exact
    mount equality on the line above already settles the `mounts` field and
    nothing here builds a link. It was catching nothing either way, which is
    worse than absent — a line that reads as a guard is counted as one. The
    resolved question is asked where a fixture actually builds the link:

    Two facts in one test because they are one decision taken twice, in

    * The extraction containers hold the USER's client, which lives outside the
      server directory and which no `chcon` of ours ever reaches; on an
      enforcing box a confined container is denied it outright
      (`yulon-fedora-gate`, Fedora 44, Docker 29.7.2, 2026-09-01). They get the
      flag, and the ANSWER comes from the seam. **Not because `run_plan`'s
      parameter is import-bound** — this docstring said so until 2026-09-01 and
      it was false, twice over: that default is `None` and the module attribute
      is looked up inside the call (`extract.py:755`), so a `monkeypatch` of
      `platform.selinux_enforcing` would be seen either way. What the two
      engines below prove is the thing that IS true: the two host shapes differ
      only in what the SEAM answers, so an engine that asked the module instead
      would give both of them the runner's own answer and the two would agree
      instead of differing. `_extract`'s docstring carries the interpreter
      output that settled it.
    * The mmaps container binds `data/` under the server directory and nothing
      else, and `stage_generate_compose` has already relabelled that directory,
      so it is readable and writable while confined. The flag would turn a
      container's confinement off to buy nothing at all, and `run_mmaps` is
      right to omit it. What transfers from the extract stage is the evidence,

    attempt began, and therefore that any compose file the app did not write
    "came down with the server's source". Reproduced on m910q 2026-09-05
    through this engine, into a folder holding a user's own `.git`,
    `my-notes.txt` and `docker-compose.yml`: the record was written, the modal
    told the user their own file came down with the clone, said "There is no
    server behind that file", and withheld the `Use existing...` offer that
    `attach_existing()` would have honoured.

    Two engine facts make that wording impossible for this family, and both are

    the seam lands under `src/`, so nothing this install downloads can put a

    anyway, written by `_run_one()` after `clone-sources`, in a folder that was
    never empty -- which is exactly why the copy may not read it as proof of
    emptiness.

    That second fact is a defect in the engine, not a design: `_claim_folder()`
    exempts any folder holding a `.git`, and only a `dest: "."` family redeems
    that exemption at the clone, so this install walks into a user's checkout.
    Filed in `pyplan/checklist.md`, NOT fixed here. Closing it will not turn
