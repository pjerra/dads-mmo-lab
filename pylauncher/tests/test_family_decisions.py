"""Every family branch decides every family (T179 Task 1, Review Focus 5).

The defect this exists for is the shape most family branches had before T179:
`if family == "azerothcore": … elif family == "cmangos": … else: nothing`. A
third family falls into the `else` at every one of them, silently, and nothing
fails -- the feature is just absent. `yulon/catalog/families/decisions.py` is
the registry that says, per site and per family, what that family gets there;
this file holds it to three things:

* **completeness** -- every site names every member of `NativeInstall.family`,
  so adding a family to the Literal turns this red at every site until somebody
  decides it;
* **coverage** -- an AST scan of `yulon/` finds every family branch (`_Scan`
  lists the spellings) and fails for one outside a registered site, for a
  registered site the scan no longer finds, and for a registered site whose
  hits changed since it was decided (`Site.hits`);
* **runway** -- `pending` is trinitycore's alone, and only while the shipped
  catalog installs no trinitycore entry.

The scan reads the AST, not text: a docstring or comment naming `cmangos` is
not a branch. The control test below holds each spelling it must catch,
including the ones a review of the first version found it missing.
