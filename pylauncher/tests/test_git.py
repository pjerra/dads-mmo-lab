"""Tests for the promoted git seam (`yulon.git`).

Most subprocess calls are mocked at the `yulon.runner.run` boundary, because
what is worth asserting about an argv decision is the argv: line endings are
pinned, depth is the caller's choice, and probing for git must never open a GUI.

The exceptions are the two `no_local_commits()` tests marked
`skipif(not git.git_available())`, and they are not decoration. That method's
answer depends on what `git fetch` WRITES, which no mock can establish — the
first version of it was wrong about exactly that, and every test covering the
case it was wrong about was a mock. Both run against local repositories only:
`git init` and a `file://` clone of it, no network and no container.

    """One legitimate update must not turn fact 4 into a refusal.

    Every OTHER `branch is None` test here mocks `runner.run`, and a mock cannot
    settle this: the question is what `git fetch` WRITES. `fetch origin
    <named-branch>` moves `refs/remotes/origin/<branch>`; `fetch origin HEAD` —
    the literal command both update paths run when the manifest names no branch,
    which is all 21 modules in the wow-wotlk catalog — moves only `FETCH_HEAD`.
    `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` is written once, at clone time, and never again.

    So a checkout that has taken one update is one commit "ahead" of that ref
    while carrying nothing of the user's, and the adoption this whole guard
    exists to permit — for a module installed by a build older than the claim
    file, which by definition has had time to be updated — is refused with
    "throws away anything you have changed there" told to somebody who changed
    nothing.

    other than the one Tortoise's six catalog facts were measured against.
