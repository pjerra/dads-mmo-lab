"""Tests for `yulon.install_wiring` — the one place the app wires an install engine.

`main.py` and `ui/controller_view.py` each hand-wrote the same `acore_*` probe
pair and the same fixed-password fallback; the CLI harness in
`catalog/installer.py` wired a third copy. Now there is one function for each,
and these tests pin them by the seams they call, not by grepping source.

    Mutations: write `line` instead of the parsed text and the first three
    assertions fail with the marker still on; drop the `progress` skip and
    `this map` appears in the transcript.
