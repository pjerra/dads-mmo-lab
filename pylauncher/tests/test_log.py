      happens before `mkdir`/`open` rather than after;
    * it LETS EVERYTHING ELSE THROUGH -- a guard that refused every directory
      would pass the assertion above and turn the other 2,500 tests into a

    * `platform.config_dir()`, as a test sees it, never answers the user's own

    that path non-existent, at `2554 passed`. The in-process redirect and
    the `_open_log` guard were both already there and neither can see a child:
    it has its own interpreter, its own `platform.config_dir`, and it inherits
    the real `HOME` of the process that started it.

    Both spellings are driven, because they take different paths through
    `child_env_with_the_users_own_log_out_of_reach` -- `env=None` is the
    inherit path (`os.environ` materialised there), `env=dict(os.environ)` is
    the copy path (compared against `os.environ` key by key) -- and the suite
    contains both.

    The second assertion is what stops the cheap pass: a child that died on
    import, or one that opened a file and recorded nothing, would satisfy "did
    not write the user's log" perfectly. Each spelling records a line of its
    OWN, because both children are pointed at the same process-wide
    `CHILD_SCRATCH_HOME` and so open the same `yulon.log`: with one shared
    marker the second iteration was reading what the first had written, and
    a mutation letting only the first record anything left this test at `1
    passed` (review, round 3). With per-spelling markers, m910q 2026-09-05,
    that mutation goes red on the second iteration -- and so does a child
    script that records the fixed default instead of its caller's marker.

    What is NOT asserted here is the real log's size across the call, the way
    the in-process guard's test asserts it: on a shared box that file is not
    this test's to predict. Measured on m910q 2026-09-05 while this suite was
    not running at all, `~/.local/share/yulon/yulon.log` grew 3,357,108 ->
    3,360,860 in three minutes, from another lane's checkout running its own
    copy of the suite without this fix. An assertion on it would go red for
    something no reader of this file could act on. The claim it stands for --

    the suite under a stand-in home, which is the RED above.

    """A caller that names none of the four must not thereby be handed all four OPEN.

    `child_env_with_the_users_own_log_out_of_reach` decided "named by the
    caller" as "differs from what this process would have handed down". An
    OMITTED variable also differs -- `given.get(var)` is `None` -- so a partial
    `env=` dict was read as four deliberate choices, each of them the choice to
    unset, and the variable was DROPPED instead of being pointed at the scratch
    home. On POSIX an absent `HOME` is not an absent route: `Path.home()` falls
    back to the passwd database, which is the user's own.

    This is not hypothetical traffic. `runner.interact(..., env={"EXIT_CODE":
    "3"})` in `test_installer.py::test_interact_raises_on_nonzero_exit_after_
    yielding_output` reaches `Popen(env=child_env(env))` with that one-key dict
    verbatim (`yulon/runner.py:241` returns it unchanged off-frozen, `:623`
    spawns with it). A census of `-n auto --dist loadfile` on m910q 2026-09-05,
    with `conftest` instrumented to record what each child was handed, found
    138 real children and exactly one holding all four routes as `None`: that
    one.

    RED, m910q 2026-09-05, this test's own child against the guard as it stood,
    serially and under `-n 2 --dist loadfile` alike:

        routes      {'XDG_DATA_HOME': None, 'APPDATA': None,
                     'HOME': None, 'USERPROFILE': None}
        config_dir  /home/pk/.local/share/yulon        <- the user's own

    The census asks what ARRIVED, not whether anything did. Each of the four
    values the child reports is compared against the scratch home this process
    hands out, because a route that is SET and points somewhere the guard did
    not choose is as open as one that is unset. It asked `value is None` until
    2026-09-05 (review, round 4), which was this commit's own subject in
    miniature: the message said the guard "blocked no route" while the
    predicate only asked whether a variable existed. Measured on m910q
    2026-09-05, with `conftest`'s rewrite line replaced by `given[var] =
    "/home/pk" if var == "HOME" else str(CHILD_SCRATCH_HOME)` -- every child
    handed the box user's own home, which is what an inherited `HOME` is in a
    run started by a person, and on macOS is the only input `config_dir()`
    reads:

        presence census   this file 25 passed; every test in the tree
                          (`-n auto --dist loadfile`, no marker filter, so
                          a superset of what `--checks` selects)
                          2575 passed, 9 skipped
        arrival census    1 failed, 24 passed, on `assert not
                          arrived_elsewhere`: `reached the OS with
                          {'HOME': '/home/pk'}`

    `config_dir()` could not have caught that one on the box it was measured
    on: `XDG_DATA_HOME` still held the scratch, so the child landed in the
    scratch and only the census saw the open door. It is asserted anyway,
    because the two answer different questions -- the census about all four
    inputs on every box, `config_dir()` about the room the one THIS OS reads
    let the child into -- and both were measured load-bearing on m910q
    2026-09-05 with the round-3 condition restored: the census red naming all
    four (`{'APPDATA': None, 'HOME': None, 'USERPROFILE': None,
    'XDG_DATA_HOME': None}`), and, with the census assertion softened to
    `assert True` on the remote copy only, `config_dir()` red on its own
    (`/home/pk/.local/share/yulon, which is the user's own`).

    Before the premise below was set explicitly, this was red only under
    `xdist`: serially the box's own `XDG_DATA_HOME` was unset, so that single
    variable compared equal to the caller's omission, was read as "not named",
    was rewritten, and carried the child to the scratch anyway -- `config_dir
    /tmp/yulon-test-child-home-7lxn4pqu/yulon`, with only `HOME` dropped
    (m910q, same date). Green on the spelling CI runs is how the bug survived
    the round that added the guard.

    The premise is SET rather than assumed: all four are pointed at a directory
    of this test's own first, so "the caller omitted a variable this process
    names" holds on a box that spells `HOME` and on one that spells
    `USERPROFILE`, serially and under `xdist` alike. That is what an `xdist`
    worker gets for free -- the guard has already handed it the controller's
    scratch in all four -- and a box-dependent version of the premise is what
    let this read as green on the spelling CI actually uses.
