"""Tests for the launcher entry point: headless provisioning, and tab wiring.

`main.py` had no tests at all before this file. What needed pinning first is
`--provision`, because its EXIT CODES are control flow for something else: the
clean-Windows harness reboots on 3 and stops on 2, so a code that drifts does
not produce a wrong message, it produces a harness that reboots forever or
gives up on a box that was fine.

The second half covers `build_window()`'s tab bookkeeping, which the packaging
smoke test (`YULON_SMOKE_TEST`) only ever proved could be built once. Those
tests drive the window through the signals the catalog view really emits,
because reaching past the signal into the closure is how the bug they pin
survived review in the first place.

def _app_window(qapp: object) -> Iterator[Any]:
    """ONE real window, built through `main.build_window()`, shared by this module.

    Repeatedly building windows is what made this file crash. Measured on Linux
    with offscreen Qt (PySide6 6.11.2), 25 runs per count:

        1 window  0/25   2 windows  2/25   3 windows  3/25
        4 windows 8/25   5 windows  9/25

    A dose-response, not a bug in any one test: each of the five passed 25/25
    alone. It surfaced as a SEGFAULT (and sometimes SIGBUS) inside whichever
    test happened to be allocating at the time - `state.remember()`, a signal
    emit - which is why three attempts at making teardown safer all measured as
    noise. Only the count matters, so there is one window and the tests share
    it.

    Sharing is safe because tabs are keyed by (game, server_dir): every test
    below uses its own directory, creates its own tab through the real signals,
    and cannot see another's. Nothing is pre-seeded into `state.json` - a tab
    arrives the way a user's does.

    Three things `build_window()` does are unacceptable in a unit test and are
    neutralised here: it reads the user's real `state.json`, writes it back
    whenever a tab is added, and starts a thread that asks GitHub for the
    latest release.

    **The update check is patched HERE and not in a test**, and so is
    `update.json`. `build_window()` imports `check_with_cache` into its own
    namespace on the way in, so a patch applied after the window exists is
    never seen by it — the window would already have asked GitHub. And this
    fixture is MODULE-scoped, so pytest builds it BEFORE the function-scoped
    autouse fixture in `conftest.py` that points `platform.config_dir()` at a
    scratch directory. Measured on this box, 2026-09-20, with a probe module
    that printed both: at module-fixture time `config_dir()` answered
    `~/.local/share/yulon` — the developer's own — and inside the test body it
    answered a `tmp_path`. So the redirect every other test relies on is simply
    not up yet here, and an unpatched check would have written the real
    `update.json`. Both doors are shut before `build_window()` is called.
