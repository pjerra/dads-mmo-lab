"""Tests for the launcher entry point: headless provisioning, and tab wiring.

`main.py` had no tests at all before this file. What needed pinning first is
`--provision`, because its EXIT CODES are control flow for something else: the
clean-Windows harness reboots on 3 and stops on 2, so a code that drifts does
not produce a wrong message, it produces a harness that reboots forever or
gives up on a box that was fine.

The second half covers `build_window()`'s tab bookkeeping, which the packaging
smoke test (`YULON_SMOKE_TEST`) only ever proved could be built once. Those
tests drive the window through the signals the catalog view really emits,
because reaching past the signal into the closure is how the bug they pin
survived review in the first place.

        1 window  0/25   2 windows  2/25   3 windows  3/25

    emit - which is why three attempts at making teardown safer all measured as
    noise. Only the count matters, so there is one window and the tests share

    Sharing is safe because tabs are keyed by (game, server_dir): every test
    below uses its own directory, creates its own tab through the real signals,
