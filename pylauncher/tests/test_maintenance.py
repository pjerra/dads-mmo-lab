    back to the first candidate only when it cannot ask AT ALL -- no docker CLI,
    a timeout, an OSError -- and unbound that first candidate is `mysql`.
    `mariadb:11` ships neither `mysql` nor `mysqldump`, and three of the four
    games this app installs run MariaDB, so the one path left to a guess guessed
    the AzerothCore answer on a MariaDB server and the backup died with

    mechanism (`_probe_client` returns None the moment `docker_program()` does)

    added with a MariaDB image and no `client` in its entry has to fail here
