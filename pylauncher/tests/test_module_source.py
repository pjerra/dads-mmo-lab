"""Tests for `yulon.module_source`: a module derived from a link or a folder.

No Qt, no git, no Docker anywhere in this file. That is the point of the module
under test: every refusal a user can meet is a pure function over a string or a
directory read, so each refusal SENTENCE is asserted here rather than through a
display that would have to be driven to show it.

Two properties are load-bearing and each has its own test rather than being a
clause inside another one:

* **A refusal writes nothing.** Every sentence ends "Nothing on this machine was
  changed.", and `test_every_refusal_sentence_ends_with_nothing_changed_...`
  asserts both halves of that claim together — the words, and an empty user root
  afterwards. A sentence that says nothing changed while something did is worse
  than no sentence.
* **A persist cannot tear.** The item file appears at its name whole or not at
  all, for `write_clone_claim()`'s reason: this app writes the file, this app
  reads it back on every start, and a half file is a list entry the user cannot
  remove from inside the app.
