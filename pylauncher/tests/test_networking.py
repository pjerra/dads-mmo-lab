"""Tests for networking auto-setup (`yulon.networking` + `platform` helpers, roadmap 3.4).

`plan()` is pure once its detection seams are pinned, so the LAN and internet
plans are asserted exactly; `apply()` runs against a recording runner and SQL
fake; the `docker.published_bindings()` parser and the firewall/portproxy
command builders are checked against the guide's literal commands.

    """The enable branch, reached from a READING rather than from the default.

    This replaces `test_a_box_with_no_ssh_at_all_enables_exactly_what_the_guide
    _says`, whose argument has been withdrawn rather than edited. That test
    passed `SshRoute()` — the default, every field's fallback — and asserted
    that it means "a box with no ssh at all", so it asserted that the plan
    SHOULD emit the §39 command list for it. On m910q the probe returned exactly
    that value from a box running sshd, and the test would have called the
    lockout correct.

    So the route here is read out of a socket table, and the table is the one
    shape that means "there is no way in to preserve": listeners, every one of
    them named, none of them an SSH daemon's or an init's — `_ONLY_GAME_SERVERS`,
    a real fedora:41 root table with the game-port stand-ins and no sshd. For
    such a machine the guide's three commands run, with no sentence printed,
    because inventing advice for a machine that is fine is how a networking
    screen teaches people to ignore it.

    Until round 4 this test used an EMPTY table for that reading, on the
    argument that `ss` lists every socket in the namespace whatever the uid.
    It does — and the namespace was the wrong thing to be sure about; see
    `test_an_empty_socket_table_is_a_private_namespace_not_a_box_without_ssh`.

    daemon down the rule is `firewall-offline-cmd`, so an `apply()` that
    re-derived it as `firewall-cmd --permanent` would look for a command that
    never ran and refuse a start it had every reason to allow — a guard that
    fires on its own bookkeeping teaches people to ignore it. The state travels
    on the plan for exactly that reason.

    The ORDER is asserted whole here, because getting the spelling right and the
    order wrong is a plan that opens nothing: the start moves to the END, which
    inverts the guide. `firewall-offline-cmd` writes the zone file, and a
    running firewalld holds its own copy and does not reread it — measured on
    the fedora:41 container, where an offline `--add-port=5555/tcp` against a
    live daemon returned 0 while `firewall-cmd --permanent --list-ports` never
    showed it. So every offline write has to land before anything starts. The
    first version of this repair left the start where the guide put it, first,
    and would have started the daemon and then written three files it ignores.

"""`firewall-cmd --permanent --list-all-zones` on yulon-fedora, 2026-09-05.

Three of the fifteen zone blocks that run printed, copied out of `sudo -n
firewall-cmd --permanent --list-all-zones` on yulon-fedora (Fedora 44,
firewalld 2.4.0, Docker 29.7.2 build 1.fc44), captured by me that day with the
box started read-only for the purpose and stopped afterwards. Two departures
from the bytes, both recorded rather than hidden: the twelve other blocks are
left out, and the trailing space firewalld prints after an empty field
(`cat -A` showed `  interfaces: $`) is not reproduced, because
`_zone_bindings()` reads the value through `.strip()` and a repo full of
trailing whitespace is a worse fixture than a footnote. The twelve blocks not
reproduced here
(FedoraServer, block, dmz, drop, external, home, internal, libvirt,
libvirt-routed, nm-shared, trusted, work) are the same shape with `interfaces:`
and `sources:` empty, and the derived values this fixture is used for are the
ones the whole 257-line listing produced on the box: `permanent` came out
`('FedoraWorkstation',)` there and comes out `('FedoraWorkstation',)` here.

What round 7 had instead was a single hand-written string whose docstring
called it "`firewall-cmd --list-all-zones` form" — a command
`detect_firewalld_zones()` never runs; the argvs it actually ran on that box,
recorded by wrapping `runner.run`, were `firewall-cmd --state`, `firewall-cmd
--permanent --list-all-zones`, `firewall-cmd --get-active-zones`, `cat
/etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf`, `ss --no-header --listening --tcp --numeric
--processes`, `stat -L -c %i /proc/1/ns/net` and `stat -L -c %i
/proc/1/ns/mnt`. That fixture bound `docker0` to `docker` and `enp0s31f6` to
`FedoraWorkstation` in the permanent listing, which is the one shape real
Docker does not produce, and the test that used it then hand-fed
`machine_made=('docker',)` past the derivation it was meant to be checking.

    2026-09-05, running round 7's module at efc6d83f inside `docker run --rm

    sentence carries ends "apply them with the firewall tool inside it", which
    writes the container's `/etc/firewalld`: the exact outcome
    `"other-mount-namespace"` was added to prevent, recommended by name.

    The refusal is right and its reason was not. What is true in there is that
    `/proc/1` is the container's init, so BOTH comparisons compare a namespace
    with itself — self mnt 4026533509 equals `/proc/1/ns/mnt` 4026533509 while
    the host's is 4026531841. So the cause is the pid namespace, and the
    remedy is to leave it (or to hand the probe `--pid=host`, after which the
    mount namespace answers for itself).

    The first is the sentence's counterexample: `/proc/1` IS this machine's
    init, both comparisons would have answered correctly, and the refusal is a
    false one. Both are refused all the same, and this test pins that they are
    refused ALIKE — the two signatures differ in TWO of the three `/proc/1`
    answers, `ns/pid` (4026531836 against 4026533510) and `ns/mnt` (4026531841
    against 4026533509), while `/proc/1/ns/net` is the host's 4026531840 in
    both, which is the row `_INITIAL_PID_NAMESPACE_INO`'s table prints for
    both spellings and what I read on m910q on 2026-09-05 — and reach the same
    cause anyway, and, in the same breath, that the module does not buy the
    difference. `/proc/1/ns/pid` would separate them and is not free: at uid
    1000 on m910q that day `os.stat` raised `EACCES` for all three of
    `/proc/1/ns/{pid,net,mnt}` and only `sudo -n stat -L -c %i
    /proc/1/ns/pid` answered (4026531836), so reading it would cost the
    elevation fallback the other two questions pay and answer `"unknown"`
    without a prefix. `_namespaced()` hands out `/proc/1/ns/pid` anyway: if
    anyone spends that read, the first signature stops being
    `"other-pid-namespace"` and this assertion goes red. It is not the only
    assertion that would: `test_the_cause_is_the_namespace_that_actually_differs`
    drives the same shape and went red beside this one under both mutations of
    round 10's driver. This test duplicates that coverage on purpose, to hold
    the DECISION not to spend the read in one readable place; round 10's gate
    file names which test each mutation reddens.

    `InstallState` in memory for a whole run and writes it back after every
    recorded stage, so an intent written into that file by anyone else — the
    Networking tab, which is another thread of the same app — is dropped by the
