"""My Party's server-side bridge: the deploy, the preconditions, the proof (8.6).

Every fact asserted here about the WotLK tree was **measured on `yulon-ubuntu`
on 2026-09-08** and is recorded in `pyplan/gates/8.6-wotlk-yulon-ubuntu-2026-09-08/`.
None of it is inherited from a sibling family: the invalid-command sentence, the
console filter on `.playerbots bot`, the module's own conf key and its compiled
default are per-tree facts, and three of the four differ from what the prior art
assumed.

The one thing this file cannot test is the bridge answering, because the Lua
engine is not compiled into the image on that box. That is the box's first
question and its answer is *no, not today* — so what is tested here is the shape
of every sentence said on the way to that answer, and the classifier that will
recognise the answer when a rebuild puts the engine in.
