"""Tests for `yulon.passwordcheck` — is this row the password we asked for? (8.3b)

A password change on the CMaNGOS trees reports a failure when it works, so the
row has to answer instead. "The row changed" is NOT that answer: any other
writer changes the row too, and a command that was refused would then be
reported as a success while the account holds somebody else's password. The
answer is the verifier itself — recomputed from the row's own salt and the
password that was asked for, and compared.

The vector below is not from a specification. It was taken off the live Vanilla
server on m910q, 2026-09-07, from an account created through this app with a
known password, and every candidate byte order was tried until one reproduced
the stored verifier exactly. Exactly one did.
