"""T129: a corrected install-plan step reaches a server whose import marker predates it.

`MarkerGate` reads any marker row as `imported` whatever its plan hash says, and
that rule is right (bug-checklist §36): re-importing over somebody's live world to
chase a catalog edit would be far worse than not. Its cost was that a corrected
or added SQL phase reached new installs only. The lead's decision (2026-09-27) is
T106's shape: detect it and OFFER it, never apply it silently.

Two things were missing, and this file is about both:

* **A record of WHICH version of each phase an install has.** The marker row
  holds one hash over the whole plan -- notes and model defaults included -- so
  it could say "something moved" and never "this phase moved". `write_marker()`
  now writes one row per phase beside it (`yulon_install_phase`: the phase's
  name and `SqlPhase.digest()`), and an install marked before that is read
  through `RELEASED_PHASE_DIGESTS`, the per-phase digests of the only plans any
  public release ever marked an install with (measured, see that table).
* **A route that applies only what is safe to apply again.** A phase is offered
  only when the catalog declares it `reapply_when_changed`; everything else that
  changed is named and withheld. The press re-reads at press time, applies the
  agreed phases that are still stale, records each one whose runs all landed,
  and leaves the marker alone.

The database here is sqlite, one file per schema, and the SQL the app writes is
EXECUTED against it: the marker script, the phase rows, the corrected
statements and the reads that come back. The one translation is the default
schema -- `mariadb -u root mangos` makes `mangos` the schema unqualified names
land in, and sqlite spells that `main`, so the fake drops the `mangos`.
qualifier on a run whose argv names `mangos`. What is unit-tested only: no
press was run on a box for this change.
