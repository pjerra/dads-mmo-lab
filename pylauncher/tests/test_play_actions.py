      with is `bot->GetLevel()`.
    * `.reset level` IS console-legal (`Chat.cpp:653`, `AllowConsole=true`), its
      handler takes only a `Player**` through `ExtractPlayerTarget` so the
      character has to be logged in, and the level it writes is
      `CONFIG_UINT32_START_PLAYER_LEVEL` (`Commands.cpp:3824-3826`).
    * `.rndbot create level=<n>` makes a NEW character at the level named.
