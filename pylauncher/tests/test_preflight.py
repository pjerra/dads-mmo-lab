    The test above states both answers through `selinux=` and `fs_type=`, so it
    could not tell that either default was BOUND AT IMPORT. Asked of the
    interpreter on m910q, against the file as the round-2 work left it
    (2026-09-05):

        signature(gather).parameters["selinux"].default
            is platform.selinux_enforcing        -> False
        signature(gather).parameters["fs_type"].default

    — one seam resolved late, one still bound, which is what made this the
    two-shape defect bug-checklist §27 was opened for rather than a dormant
    one. ONE patch of `platform.filesystem_type` was answered two ways by the
    two consumers of that one attribute (m910q, 2026-09-05, before the fix):

        ContainerGit()._ask_filesystem(Path("/tmp")) -> 'btrfs'      (the fake)
        gather(...).server_fs_type                   -> 'ext2/ext3'  (the host)
        asked: ['fs:/tmp']

    "EITHER default" is a claim, so it was mutated rather than asserted. Each
    default was put back to the module function on its own, `__pycache__`
    purged between, m910q 2026-09-05:

        selinux rebound at import -> 1 failed in 0.37s
        fs_type rebound at import -> 1 failed in 0.89s

    It fails on every host rather than only on one whose real answers happen to
    differ, because the fakes COUNT their calls: `asked` is short by an entry
    before any value is compared. Asserting the parameters exist would have
    proved nothing — that distinction is what §27 asked for.
