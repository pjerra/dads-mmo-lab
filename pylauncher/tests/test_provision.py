"""Tests for Docker/WSL2 provisioning (`yulon.platform`, roadmap 5.1) through its seams.

Nothing here installs anything: `run`, `which` and `download` are fakes, and
`detect()` is pinned via `sys.platform`. The assertions are about the plans
(exact commands per OS), the honesty rules (reboot/re-login reported, nothing
silent), and the early exit when a daemon already answers.
