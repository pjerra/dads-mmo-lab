    `image_refs=composegen.built_image_refs(entry, server_dir)` with
    `image_refs=()` at `yulon/ui/controller_view.py:778` left the whole suite
    byte-identical -- 3597 passed and the same five Windows line-ending failures
    -- while every WotLK install's four images leaked on every uninstall for
    ever. The same mutation at `:1128` was caught at once, by
    `test_uninstall_second_family.py::test_the_vanilla_uninstall_removes_this_installs_images_and_not_the_shared_one`,
    which is why this is enumerated over the catalog rather than written twice:
    a per-family assertion is a per-family hole, and 8.9c and 8.9d will each
    add a third and a fourth wiring of the identical five lines.

    The `_FakeUninstall` in `test_controller_view.py`'s 8.9a section is the
    other half of the reason nothing saw it: that whole section assigns
    `services.uninstall = fake`, so the real `for_entry()` is never asked what
    it wired.

    **What the refs must not be, and it is not hypothetical.** The bash prior
    art derives its removal list from the compose FILE
    (`_compose_server_images`, `cli/src/90-main.sh:80`), which includes the
    PULLED database image, and its whole defence is that the daemon refuses a
    removal while somebody holds it -- `docker image rm` failing becomes a
    warn. On m910q that defence is absent: `wow-vanilla` and `wow-tbc` both
    pull `mariadb:11`, the TBC install has no containers at all, so the daemon
    would not refuse, and a neighbour's next start would re-pull 458 MB over
    that box's known-flaky link. `built_image_refs()` never names a pulled
    image, so the safety is structural rather than a race the daemon usually
    wins.
