"""The rebuild control: the action `_format_report` has always named and never offered.

The Modules tab prints "worldserver REBUILD required before this takes effect"
after every module install whose manifest sets `build.rebuild` — 20 of the 41
shipped manifests, all of them `module`. Until this file there was no button
anywhere in `yulon/ui/` that started one, so those twenty entries could not work
at all on a server that was already built, and the sentence named an action the
app did not have.

Re-pressing Install was not it, and that is very probably what the user who
reported this meant by "i used the this thing to rebuild the server but nothing
changes when i log back in" (2026-09-07): `stage_build()` skips the compile when
the state file records a build AND the daemon holds every image, and the image
tag is derived from the FOLDER, so adding a module never changes it. Measured on
yulon-ubuntu through the app's own predicates: `state.has("build")` True,
`built_images()` True, `build_would_be_skipped()` True.

So the rebuild is not "run the install again". It is the build stage with the
skip rule switched off, the containers recreated from the image it produces, and
the readiness wait the install ends with — and the tests below are about the
force, the refusals, the cancel, and the fact that the progress a user watches is
the installer's own, not a second reporting scheme that can drift from it.

What is unit-tested only is stated in the report and in
`test_the_recreate_argv_does_not_rely_on_compose_noticing_a_new_image`: no
rebuild was run for this change.
