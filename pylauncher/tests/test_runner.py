HANG_BOUND = 30.0
"""A DEADLOCK BREAKER for every in-process wait here, not an assertion about speed.

Each wait it sizes is for a child process to print its first line, or for a
worker thread to leave a generator once its child has been ended — work that
costs milliseconds when it happens at all. Measured on m910q (4 cores)
2026-09-05 with `--durations`, the two tests these bounds sit in reported
`0.07s call` and `0.26s call`, and most of the second is a Python interpreter
starting. Thirty seconds is two orders of magnitude above the worse of them.

Large on purpose, because the bound is on THIS process while the contention is
on the box — bug-checklist §33 records what a stopwatch-sized bound cost: 60
seconds against a run measured at 0.16s went red under 15-way load, and the run
it happened in was read as a real failure. Deleting the bounds is not an option
either: every wait here is on a thread whose only way out is a child process
ending, so a wedged subject with no bound is a suite that never returns, which
CI reports as a stuck job rather than a red one.

DRIVER_BOUND = 120.0
"""`HANG_BOUND` for the driver SUBPROCESSES, and deliberately larger than it.

The drivers below bound their own waits with `HANG_BOUND` — it is substituted
into their source, so there is one number and not two. This one has to outlast
that: a driver that fails its own assertion must get to write the sentence
saying which half went wrong, rather than be killed by `subprocess.run`'s
timeout first and reported as "timed out". Measured on m910q 2026-09-05, the
two tests that spawn a driver reported `0.07s call` and `0.26s call`.

GIVE_UP = 0.3

A deadline the test wants to pass, not one it is judged by, so a loaded box
only makes it pass more surely. Its number is in the runner's own words

Nothing is judged by it and lengthening it only makes the loop coarser. It is
named because `conftest.spelled_bounds` reads every `time.sleep` in the file

`conftest.JOB_PACE` is named.

    The driver test above abandons its generator suspended at a `yield`, and

    `native._pump()` starts a daemon worker that executes
    `docker.run_attached()`, which sits in `for line in lines` INSIDE a
    `stream()` generator — so the frame is being run by the worker at the
    moment the hook fires, and `close()` from the main thread cannot enter it.

    """The end-to-end shape of the test above: a real exit, and the grandchild must be gone.

    Measured on m910q 2026-09-04, before the exit hook could reach a running
    frame: the driver exited 0 — no abort, because the child was never
    touched and no lock was ever contended — and the ticker was still alive
    afterwards with PPID 1, a `python -c` sleeping for ten minutes that
    nothing would ever own. That is the launcher's own shape: `_pump()`'s
    worker inside `docker.run_attached()` inside `stream()`, a `docker compose
    build` outliving the app that started it.

    The liveness probe is `/proc/<pid>`, so the grandchild assertion runs on
    Linux only; the exit status and the absence of a fatal error are asserted
    everywhere. Once the driver has gone its orphan is reparented and reaped
    on death, so a `/proc` entry that persists is a process that persists.

    **The driver's own `work()` catches `BaseException`, and that is not
    decoration — it is the difference between this test flaking and not.**
    Until 2026-09-05 it was a bare `for _line in gen`, so the
    `CalledProcessError` the exit hook's terminate raises inside the generator
    escaped into `threading.excepthook`, which prints a traceback to stderr —
    while the interpreter was finalising, which is exactly when stderr's lock
    may be held by a daemon thread that will never be resumed. Measured on
    m910q (4 cores) 2026-09-05, sixty consecutive runs of this test on the
    combined tree: **2 of 60 aborted (runs 16 and 54), `nonzero=2 fatal=2`**,

        Exception in thread Thread-1 (work): ... File "<string>", line 23, in work
        Fatal Python error: _enter_buffered_busy: could not acquire lock for
        <_io.BufferedWriter name='<stderr>'> at interpreter shutdown, possibly
        due to daemon threads

    — the very `_enter_buffered_busy` abort bug-checklist §40 exists to close,
    raised here by the TEST rather than by `runner`. The meta review measured
    the same shape twice more, at 1 in 150 raw runs. Production's bridge worker
    has caught `BaseException` since 7.1; the driver now models it, and
    **180 runs afterwards on the same box (60 then 120) gave
    `nonzero=0 fatal=0` both times** — a 3%-of-60 flake needs a sample to say
    it is gone, not a single green run.

    §40 turned `stream()` from a generator function into a plain function that
    builds one and registers it, and its docstring says both things about the
    result — that the registration happens at the call, and that "the body is
    still lazy, so no process starts until the first `next()`". Until
    2026-09-05 neither half had a test: the meta review found the laziness
    sentence owned by nothing, and the obvious way to lose it is a refactor
    that fills `_Child.proc` in eagerly so the exit hook never sees a `None` —
    which would start a `docker compose build` for a generator the caller may
    never iterate.

    Both halves are asserted here because they pull against each other. A
    version that starts the child at the call satisfies the registration
    assertion and fails the laziness one; a version that registers lazily (a

    The audit `test_log_panel.py`, `test_job.py`, `test_prompt.py`,
    `test_catalog_view.py` and `test_steam_deck_script.py` already run on
    themselves (bug-checklist §33), opted into here on 2026-09-05: the §40
    tests above added four kinds of bound to a file that had no audit -- until
    2026-09-05 they were spelled `lines.get(timeout=30)`,
    `worker.join(timeout=10)`, `subprocess.run(timeout=120)` and three
    hand-built `time.monotonic() + 5`; this commit renamed every one of them to
    `HANG_BOUND` / `DRIVER_BOUND`, which is what the audit reads today. That
    is the state §33 is about — a
    number typed at a call site carries no argument for its size, and these
    bounds are the only thing in this file a loaded box can move.

    `HANG_BOUND`, `DRIVER_BOUND` and `POLL_PACE` are named individually rather
    than counted, because they mean three different things: one is a deadlock
    breaker, the second must OUTLAST the first (a driver has to outlive its own
    internal bound to report its own failure), and the third is a poll interval
    nothing is judged by.

    **What this audit cannot see, stated so the price is known.** It reads the
    source of this file, so the bounds inside the driver scripts — which are
    string constants until a subprocess compiles them — are invisible to it;
    they are spelled `__HANG_BOUND__` and `__POLL_PACE__` and substituted from
    the names above, so there is one number rather than two, but nothing
    enforces that. `time.monotonic()` is in the set because three tests here
    measure elapsed time as their ASSERTION, and that costs this file the
    strongest thing the audit does elsewhere: a NEW hand-built deadline would
    not change the set. Neither `threading.Timer(1.0, ...)` nor the
    `assert elapsed < 30`-shaped proofs are read at all — `conftest.spelled_bounds`
    documents its reading, and a comparison is not a call.

    **Measured both ways on m910q 2026-09-05.** A bare `time.sleep(3)` appended
    to this file fails this test — `Extra items in the left set: '3'`. The same
    bound spelled through an alias (`import time as _t` then `_t.sleep(3)`)
    left it at `1 passed`: `conftest.spelled_bounds` matches the SPELLING
    `time.sleep`, so an aliased import is invisible to it in every file that
