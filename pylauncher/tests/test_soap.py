"""Tests for `yulon.soap` — one command envelope over the standard library (8.2a).

Driven against a real `http.server` on 127.0.0.1 rather than a mock: this module
exists to speak HTTP to something, and the failures worth catching are wire
failures — a 401, a fault body, a socket that accepts and says nothing. A mock
would confirm the code calls the functions it calls.

The envelope shape is `ns1__executeCommand(soap*, char* command, char** result)`
(`cmangos.md:122` names the same symbol on that family) in namespace `urn:AC`,
which is what the Hypeer launcher's working client posts to
`http://127.0.0.1:7878/` (`hypeer.md:48`, `soap.rs:127-132`). That is prior art
that runs, not a derivation, and 8.2a's gate is where this client's own
round-trip confirms it against a real worldserver.
