"""A DEADLOCK BREAKER for every thread wait here, not an assertion about speed.

Each wait it sizes is for a fake `call` on a `_pump()` worker to be released,
or for that thread to end — an `Event.set()` away in a healthy run. Measured on
m910q (4 cores) 2026-09-05, the six `_pump()` abandonment tests below run
together on an idle box: `6 passed, 83 deselected in 0.40s`.

Large on purpose: the bound is on THIS process while the contention is on the
box, and bug-checklist §33 records what a stopwatch-sized bound cost — 60
seconds against a run measured at 0.16s went red under 15-way load, and the run
it happened in was read as a real failure. Deleting the bounds is not an option
either: `_pump()`'s worker is only released by the cancel event this fix sets,
so a regression with no bound is a suite that never returns, which CI reports
as a stuck job rather than a red one.

The two proofs that a bound was NOT waited out are written against a fraction
of `native.ABANDONED_WORKER_SECONDS` — the bound they say was skipped — rather
than against a number of their own, so neither can drift from what it disproves.

Eight, enumerated. It said "every spelling a Python file can use" until

audit unable to fail on the class it enumerates; `glob`/`rglob`/`walk` closed
the class the first review reported; `iglob`/`fwalk` closed the two the NEXT

absolute cannot, so this one is enumerated and
`test_the_listing_audit_sees_every_spelling_it_names` drives all eight through

third-party walker, a subprocess `ls` -- this audit does not see and does not
claim to.

unmutated). `installer.py`'s write decision -- `native._listing(server_dir,
ignoring=native.STATE_FILE)` -- respelled `server_dir.glob("*")` gives

off `_listing_sites()` on the same mutated tree rather than inferred from the
run: with the six spellings of that morning it returns 12 sites and NOT

the same day, when a review pointed out that `apply.py` makes the same write

it: "this engine" was still a wider claim than its evidence, one level out.

Written out rather than derived: the map IS the claim, and one computed from the
code would agree with whatever the code did.

A reason per site, because "is this a write decision?" is the only question that
