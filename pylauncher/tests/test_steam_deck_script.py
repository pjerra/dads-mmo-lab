"""The one bash file that survives 7.2: `catalog/installers/steam-deck/setup-gaming-mode.sh`.

Gate the tool, not the payload. Nothing here starts Docker, but most of it is
still behavioural: bash sources `$BASH_ENV` when it runs a script
non-interactively, and a shell function beats a `PATH` lookup, so `_stubs()`
replaces `docker`, `pgrep`, `clear` and `sleep` with functions and the script
runs end to end in milliseconds. A shim DIRECTORY would not work — the script's
own `export PATH="/usr/bin:..."` puts the real `/usr/bin/docker` in front of
anything the caller prepended — which is why the stubs are functions.

`sleep` records its argument instead of waiting. That is what lets a
300-second client wait be asserted inside one test second, and it is the seam
the no-tty tests read: the defect they pin is a `read` that returns instantly
at EOF *where a sleep belonged*, so "did it sleep" is the question.

Some tests remain source-shape reads of the script text (`_code()`): they pin
how a line is spelled, not what the script does, and a harmless respelling fails
them exactly as a real defect would. Comment lines are stripped before those
reads, so a rule quoted in the header cannot satisfy an assertion about the code.
Each such test says so in its own docstring, which is where the fact belongs --
this sentence used to give the number, and the number was wrong (it said three;
there are four `_code()` call sites). A count of its own contents is the one
thing a module docstring cannot keep true.

"""A DEADLOCK BREAKER, not an assertion about how fast the script runs.

Every test here stubs `sleep` so it records instead of waiting, so a healthy
run of the longest of them costs milliseconds. Measured on yulon-ubuntu
2026-09-02: this whole file took 3.57s serially, of which the 300-second client
wait was 0.16s, and under `-n auto --dist loadfile` alongside the rest of the
suite no test in it reached the slowest-twelve list at all (the twelfth was
0.61s).

The number is nonetheless large on purpose, because the bound is on the CHILD
and the contention is on the BOX. A gate reviewer watched
`test_without_a_terminal_the_client_wait_sleeps_instead_of_reading_stdin` spend
the whole of the previous 60-second bound under 15-way parallel load and then
pass 14 times out of 14 re-run serially, and that VM runs its fifteen workers
with about 2 GB free -- a starved or swapping box can stall a process for a
minute without anything being wrong with it. A bound sized like a stopwatch
turns that into a red suite, and the run it happened in was read as a real
single failure (bug-checklist section 33): three clean re-runs later, a merge
went through on a result nobody had explained.

So it is sized against the failure it can actually catch. Contention is bounded
-- some multiple of a run that costs milliseconds -- while a hang is unbounded,
and any finite bound catches an unbounded wait eventually. Deleting the bound
is not an option: without one this file's pty test WEDGED the suite when its
subject regressed, which CI reports as a stuck job rather than a red one (see
`test_with_a_terminal_enter_still_stops_the_server`). Five minutes is the price
of reporting such a regression as a failure.
