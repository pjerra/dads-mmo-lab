"""Opening Yu'lon never boots a stopped WSL distro (T133, wsl-resident-servers §2).

Measured on a Windows 11 box (T132 M7): from the user's desktop session ANY read
under `\\\\wsl.localhost\\<distro>\\...` starts a stopped distro (1.35 s), so a
Server tab that read its install's files when it opened booted the distro, and a
server killed earlier came back by itself through `restart: unless-stopped`.

The disk double below records every touch of the distro's folder while WSL says
the distro is stopped -- an open, a listing, a stat, or a child process run in
it or naming it (`wsl -d <distro>`, git with its cwd there) -- and the tests
open the real tab, built through the real `ControllerServices.for_entry()`, and
run its polls. WSL is faked at its listing only, so the app's own answer to "is
it running" (`wsl.distro_state()`) is the real one.
