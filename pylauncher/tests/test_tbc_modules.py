"""TBC modules: a manifest set for a core that has no compiled modules (roadmap 8.7b).

AzerothCore modules are git repositories compiled into the worldserver. CMaNGOS
has nothing of the kind, so on `wow-tbc` a "module" is one of exactly two
things the existing schema already expresses:

* a **configuration activation** — `conf[].keys` written into a file the
  install already owns (`etc/mangosd.conf`), which is what `apply._conf()` does;
* a **SQL mod** — `sql[].statement` run against this game's own world schema.

So this file proves the BINDING and the RELATIONSHIPS, not a new engine. The
relationships are where the defects live, and each has no owner on either side:

* a manifest names a conf FILE; the catalog's installer decides which conf
  files exist and where. Nothing on either side compares them.
* a manifest writes a conf KEY; the installer's own `conf` table rewrites its
  keys on every install and repair. A module that picked one of those keys
  would be silently undone by the next run, and neither file can see the other.
* a manifest names a DATABASE (`world`, `playerbots`, ...); the entry decides
  which of those this core actually has. `playerbots` and `ale` are
  AzerothCore's and a TBC manifest naming one would reach `DockerSql` and die
  on `Unknown database`.
* every TBC manifest must ask for a RESTART and never a rebuild — there is no
  binary to rebuild, and mangosd reads `etc/mangosd.conf` once, at startup.
