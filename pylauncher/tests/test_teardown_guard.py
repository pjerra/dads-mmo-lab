"""One answer to "may this tab be torn down now?" (T690).

Three guards used to answer it differently (`forget_refusal()`, `busy_reason()`
and `_client_dir_busy()`), and a Restore, a backup, a network apply, a module
job or a Start/Stop/Restart was invisible to most of the doors that tear a tab
down. Measured live on m910q: a client-folder change during a backup froze the
window for 7 minutes and the backup vanished.

Two kinds of test live here. The BEHAVIOUR tests drive the real `ControllerView`
(offscreen) with each kind of work running and ask every door that is on the
tab. The RELATIONSHIP test reads the source: it finds every function that tears
something down (a `drop_controller()` call, a quit, a forced exit, a rebuild
signal) and fails for any that does not reach `teardown_work()`, so a door added
later without the guard fails here and not in a player's restore.

Mutations (each must turn a test below RED):
- drop one kind from `ControllerView.teardown_work()`;
- drop the `teardown_refusal()` call from `_client_dir_busy()`;
- drop the guard from any door the relationship test lists.
