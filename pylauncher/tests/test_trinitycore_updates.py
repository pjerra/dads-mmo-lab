"""T179 Task 6: "Update the server to latest…" and "Return to the tested pin…" on TrinityCore.

The owner's decision 2 (T179 spec §3): the code is pulled and rebuilt as on every
family; of the snapshot under `centurion/sql`, only the world's per-table files that
changed are imported again -- after the backup the route offers, as root, with the
database-name renames -- and a change to the characters' layout is refused with a
message naming the file and nothing changed. A change to the server's DBC files or
to a required client pack means the map data must be extracted again: a flag and a
sentence for the Server tab, and `reextract()`, which runs the client-data stage
again through the temporary extraction client and clears the movement maps.

Git is the Recorder's (`diffs`, `diff_lines`), the database `FakeMysql`, the world
server's container a `World` that goes down on a stop and up on a start, and the
movement-map job `FakeMmapsDocker` -- so each test drives the real
`update_to_latest()` and `rebuild()` and reads what landed where.
