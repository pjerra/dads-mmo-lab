"""What an uninstall has to know about the SECOND family (8.9b, WoW Vanilla).

8.9a's box gates uninstall on two families rather than four "because the
mechanism is the compose project and the folder, which are the engine's and not
the emulator's" (`pyplan/checklist.md`, line 2506). That claim was checked
against the real Vanilla install at `/home/pk/vanilla-75b` on m910q,
2026-09-08, and it holds for the OBJECTS:

* the folder carries the same `.yulon-install.json` claim (`family: cmangos`,
  `install_id: 06ced116`) that ownership is proved from;
* `docker-compose.yml` carries `name: yulon-wow-vanilla-06ced116`, the same
  `yulon-<game>-<install id>` `composegen.project_name()` computes;
* its volume `yulon-wow-vanilla-06ced116_db-data` carries
  `com.docker.compose.project=yulon-wow-vanilla-06ced116`, so the label filter
  every scoped command uses answers on this tree exactly as it does on WotLK
  (`docker volume ls --filter label=…` returned that one name and nothing else).

It fails for three RELATIONSHIPS, and each has a test here. None of them is
about an emulator: they are about what the folder holds, what the project
declares, and what the launcher's record points at — which is to say they are
about the very mechanism the box says is shared.

Nothing here starts a container, reads a network or writes outside `tmp_path`.

    `purge.Uninstaller.run(keep_characters=True)` keeps `<project>_db-data` and

    story: `wow-wotlk`'s password plan is `fixed`, so the value is in
    `catalog.json` and a reinstall regenerates a compose file carrying the same
    one.

    On the CMaNGOS tree the password is GENERATED per install and written to
    `.db_password` inside the folder the purge deletes (measured on
    `~/vanilla-75b`: `.db_password` 0600, 25 bytes, and the same secret again in
    plaintext in `.env` — both inside the folder). The volume name is a digest
    of the ABSOLUTE PATH, so it does not change when the folder is deleted and
    recreated: what is kept is a database nothing can open any more.
