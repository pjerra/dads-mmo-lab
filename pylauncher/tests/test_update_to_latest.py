"""T64: "Update the server to latest…" — the route, its refusals and its restores.

The engine half. The button, its three-way dialog and the backup it chains are
in `test_controller_view.py`, beside the rebuild press they copy.

**What every test here is arranged around.** The one thing this route can do
that nothing else in the app can is leave a source tree and a running image
disagreeing: the folder a hundred commits ahead of the binary answering on the
port, with nothing on screen saying so and every later reading — the Modules
tab, a version line, a bug report — telling the truth about the wrong thing.
So the assertions are not "the route raised": they are what `heads` holds
afterwards, which is the fact a user cannot check and the one that quietly
breaks everything downstream. A test that only asserted the exception would
pass against a route that fetched, failed and walked away.

    Three ordinary presses on a `depth: 1` source — clone at the pin, "Update to
    latest", "Return to the tested pin" — leave `.git/shallow` holding TWO
    grafted commits with no edge between them: the tip the update fetched and
    the pin the return fetched back. `rev-list --count FETCH_HEAD..HEAD` then
    answers 1 and `merge-base --is-ancestor` answers no, and on the update route
    alone (`_refuse_unless_updatable()`) that read as "carries commits that
    upstream does not" and refused BOTH buttons, permanently, on a checkout
    nobody had committed anything into. Measured live on a real playerbots
    clone, 2026-09-16; `git.no_local_commits()`'s `_only_grafts()` is what lets
    it through, and this is the route-layer test that pins the pair together.

    The shape is BUILT BY THE ROUTE, not by writing `.git/shallow`: a
    hand-written graft file would prove this route survives a file a test wrote,
    and the whole finding is that the app's own two presses are what make it.
    `_grafts()` is asserted before the third press for exactly that reason — if
    a future `_pin()` stopped leaving two boundaries, this test would go on
    passing while testing nothing, and the assertion is what makes it fail
    instead.

    Both directions are pressed afterwards, because the live refusal was both:
    the guard is the same code on the way out and the way back, so a fix that
    only freed the update would strand a user one press further along.
