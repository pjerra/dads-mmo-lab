    The command is refused (this core refuses by hanging up, so the channel
    answers `unknown`), and while that happens somebody else changes the same
    account's password. The row is now different from what it was — which is
    exactly what the first version of this took as proof — and it is not this
    password, so the answer is no.

    A false POSITIVE is not merely unlikely here, it is unreachable: the only
    row that says yes is a row holding the password this call was given, and
    then "the password was changed" is true whoever wrote it.
