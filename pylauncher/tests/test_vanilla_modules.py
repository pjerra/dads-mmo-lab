"""Vanilla modules: the TBC manifest shape pointed at mangos-classic (roadmap 8.7c).

8.7c's box reads "as 8.7b", and the honest reading of that is *the same shape,
this tree's own facts*. The shape is settled and is not re-argued here: CMaNGOS
compiles no modules, so an item is a **configuration activation** into a conf
the install already owns or a **SQL mod** against this game's world schema
(`controller_wow_tbc.modules`, and `test_tbc_modules.py` beside this file).

What this file exists for is the half that is NOT shared. Every value below was
read off `~/vanilla-75b` on m910q on 2026-09-08 — the conf this install actually
has and the `src/mangos-classic` checkout it was built from — and three of them
differ from the TBC sibling that was written the day before:

* **`AllowTwoSide.Interaction.Trade` exists here.** mangos-classic reads it at
  `src/game/World/World.cpp:525`, and `etc/mangosd.conf:928` ships it; the TBC
  manifest's own note says the key is absent on that fork. So cross-faction is
  **ten** pairs on this tree and nine on that one, and a copied manifest would
  leave trading switched off on a realm that had been told it was on.
* **There are no `Rate.XP.Kill.Vanilla` / `.BC` twins.** `World.cpp:422` sets
  `Rate.XP.Kill` and nothing else of that family, so the per-tier caveat in the
  TBC manifest's notes is not a fact about this game.
* **`Rate.Pet.XP.Kill` sits two lines above `Rate.XP.Kill`** in the shipped conf
  (`etc/mangosd.conf:1509-1510`). An unanchored `Rate\\.XP\\.Kill` would match it,
  so the anchoring the TBC manifests use is load-bearing HERE in a way it was
  not there, and `test_the_xp_mod_leaves_the_pet_rate_alone` is the assertion
  that says so.

The relationships this proves are the same four the TBC file proves, because
they are relationships and no single file owns them: a manifest names a conf
FILE the catalog's installer must actually create; a manifest writes a conf KEY
that installer must not rewrite on its next repair; a manifest names a DATABASE
this entry must actually have; and every item must ask for a restart and never
for a rebuild.
