"""The write ledger and the walk that enforces it, in both directions (8.1a).

Grafted from design C, which the maintainer judge called the single best test
idea in the three designs: an `ast` enumeration of every place this package
writes, checked against a table a person maintains, failing **both** when a
write is not in the table and when a table row names a write that no longer
exists. One direction alone rots — the first lets a new write appear unnoticed,
the second lets the table fill with lines about code that is gone.

Why it lands in 8.1a rather than at the exit box: this is the step that adds the
first new write sites (the log snapshot), and a ledger written after the writes
is a ledger written from the code rather than from the intent.

The walker's own tests come first here, because a walker that misses a call
makes every row below it a false assurance — the failure mode this project has
already paid for once, recorded in `guards-that-prove-declarations`.
