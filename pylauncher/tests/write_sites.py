"""Finds every place `yulon/` writes, and reads the ledger that must list them.

Test support, not shipped code — it lives beside `support_compose.py` and
`support_native.py` for the same reason: it is machinery a test needs and
nothing in the app should be able to import.

**What counts as a write, and why the list is shaped like this.** Three of the
call spellings here were chosen against a specific way of being wrong:

* `.open(...)` is checked by MODE, because `Path.open("wb")` is how the log
  snapshot writes and a walk that only knew the builtin `open()` would miss it.
* `os.replace` is matched only when it is qualified by `os`, because bare
  `.replace(` in this package is `str.replace` four times out of five and a
  ledger full of string operations is a ledger nobody reads.
* `run_statement`/`run_file` are the SQL seam's write half. `query()` is
  deliberately absent: it is the read half, and `dbreads` is allowed to call it.
* `write_marker` is the fourth SQL write and the narrowest widening this list
  has had (T19). The install engine does not reach a database through the
  `sql` seam at all: `sqlplan` execs the client with the SQL on its stdin, the
  third shape the 2026-09-08 audit found this walk blind to, and the ledger has
  said so in prose since T14 rather than in a row. Teaching the walk that whole
  seam is a bigger change than one ticket -- `apply()` streams whatever a plan
  names -- but the marker row is one function with one spelling, and T19 put a
  BUTTON on it: a press that writes a completion marker on a person's word, and
  a ledger that says "every place" while missing it would be missing the one
  write a user can now ask for by name. So the function is named, exactly as
  `docker volume rm` is named by its argv, and the rest of the seam stays
  recorded in the page's prose as open.

`os.open` counts without its flags being inspected. It is how a file gets a
private mode at creation time, and over-inclusive is the safe direction for a
ledger: a read that gets a row costs a line, while a write that gets none costs
the whole guarantee. It was missing until 2026-09-07, and what found it was this
test's OTHER direction — a hand-written row that resolved to no site.

`mkdir` is deliberately NOT a write here. Creating an empty directory puts no
content anywhere, there are twenty-odd of them, and content still needs one of
the calls above — so nothing can hide behind one. Named rather than omitted.

A volume holds every character on an install. `docker volume rm` destroys one in
a single command with no undo and nothing on the filesystem to recover from, and
it is the most destructive thing Phase 8 added — yet it was invisible to this
walk until 2026-09-08, because the destruction is not a Python call at all: it
is an argv handed to a subprocess, and this module's whole vocabulary was
`shutil` and `Path`.

Matched on the ARGV and not on the function that runs it. A rule keyed to
`_docker(` is a rule a rename walks past, and this project has already paid for
that once (`audit-by-argv-not-by-string`): the same action spelt as a Python
list is invisible to a guard that knows one shell spelling of it.

**What is deliberately NOT here, named rather than omitted, the way `mkdir` is:**
the verbs that only MAKE things — `run`, `build`, `pull`, `up`, `create`,
`image tag`. Each changes the machine and none can lose anything the user had,
and the ledger's own vocabulary is what can be lost. Including them would add a
dozen rows about creation and bury the four that matter.

**And what this still cannot see:** an argv assembled rather than written out —
`argv = ["volume"]` then `argv.append("rm")`. Nothing in the package does that
today; a walk that tried to follow it would be an interpreter.
