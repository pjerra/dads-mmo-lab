"""The declarative apply engine: turn a `Manifest` into install/configure/remove steps.

This is the one place the manifest primitives (`source`, `deploy`, `patches`,
`sql`, `conf`, `client`, `server_dbc`) acquire behavior (roadmap 2.3). It is
game-agnostic and shared by every `controller_<acronym>/modules.py`
(style-guide §4); all per-item knowledge comes from the manifest, never from
a conditional here. Everything that reaches outside the process goes through
a small seam (`Git`, `SqlRunner`, `DbcCopier`) so the engine is unit-testable
without git, Docker or a network, and so the real implementations live next
to the other subprocess code.

Nothing is ever skipped silently: every step a run could not perform (no SQL
runner, no client dir, no DBC copier) is named in `ApplyReport.skipped`, and
`rebuild_required` says whether the worldserver must be rebuilt before the
change is live. The engine does not restart, rebuild, or touch Docker itself —
that is the controller's call (call down / signal up, §5).

    def _require_own_clone(self, manifest: Manifest, clone: Path, action: When) -> None:
        """Refuse `modules/<id>` unless this app can show the folder is its own.

        Both destructive paths go through here, and neither had anything before
        (three reviewers, 2026-08-31). `install()` handed the path straight to
        the clone seam, which `shutil.rmtree`s a destination that is not a git
        checkout and runs `git fetch` + `git reset --hard FETCH_HEAD` on one
        that is, without ever comparing its origin; `remove()` deleted it
        outright. The path is not obscure: it is `modules/<id>` under the
        server dir, which is exactly where an AzerothCore user installs a
        module by hand, and the id comes from a catalog this app chose. The
        shipped Modules tab binds "Install selected" to `install()` directly,
        so one press over a hand-made `modules/mod-x` was enough.

        The order is the order of the evidence, cheapest and most certain
        first, and nothing is written before all of it is in:

        0. Nothing at the path: the ordinary first install, and the only case
           with nothing to lose. Allowed without asking git anything.
        1. Not a directory — a FILE at the clone path is somebody's,
           and neither `rmtree` nor a clone may decide what it was.
        2. A directory with no `.git`: hand-installed content, or a tarball
           unpacked there. Refused if it holds anything, allowed if it is an
           empty folder somebody made — there is nothing there to lose.
        3. A checkout this app's own claim vouches for: allowed, and this is
           the ONLY way through. `read_clone_claim()` says why the claim is
           enough on its own here, where `catalog.native` needs its record
           corroborated by `origin`.
        4. A checkout of the right repository with no claim, in a server
           directory this app installed, with nothing modified in it and no
           commits of its own: adopted. `_adoption_refusal()` has the four
           facts, why three of them were not enough, and — when one of them
           says no — which one the user is told about.
        5. Everything else is a checkout this app did not make. `origin` is
           asked only to say WHICH refusal — a different repository, this
           repository, or a git that would not answer — because every branch
           of it refuses. That is the divergence from
           `native.refuse_unowned_checkout()`, which can be reached with the
           question already answered by its caller.

        `UNKNOWN` is refused with its own sentence, per `Ownership`: a damaged
        claim means this app knows LESS than an absent one, so it must not act
        more freely.

        **`action` is here because a refusal's REMEDY is not the same for the
        three callers, and one wrong remedy causes the harm it prevents.** The
        first version said "move the folder aside" everywhere. For `install()`
        that is right and cheap. For `remove()` it is advice to strand yourself:
        moving the clone aside makes `clone.exists()` false, and then this run's
        remove-time SQL and `_undeploy()` either fail outright (an `in_clone`
        patch or an SQL file that is no longer there) or quietly leave the
        deployed files behind — so the module stays half-installed in the
        database with no route back through the app. Every `remove()` refusal
        therefore keeps the user pointed at removing, and says why the folder
        must not simply be made to disappear.

        **Does `remove()` accept weaker proof than `install()`? Yes — one
        specific piece of it, and no more.** The asymmetry is in what a refusal
        COSTS. Refusing `install()` costs the user nothing they had: their
        folder is untouched, and the remedy (move it aside, install again) is a
        download. Refusing `remove()` costs them the only in-app route to a
        clean database, and there is no second one — the rows and the deployed
        files stay, forever, and the folder they were told to move aside is not
        the problem. The relocation case makes that a real lockout rather than a
        theoretical one: `install_id()` is a hash of the ABSOLUTE path, so
        moving or renaming a server folder makes EVERY claim in it read
        `UNKNOWN` at once.

        So `remove()` — and only `remove()` — also accepts
        `claim_written_by_this_app()`: a claim that parses, carries this
        version, names THIS item, and differs from `OWNED` in exactly one field,
        the folder it was written in. That is this app's own handwriting; a
        hand-installing user does not produce it, and a stranger's checkout has
        no claim file at all. What it cannot distinguish is a MOVED install from
        a COPIED one — nothing on disk can — and that is the whole of what is
        given up: in a copy, `remove()` deletes a clone that this app made a copy
        of, for an item the user has just asked to remove. `install()` is not
        given the same licence, because there the same input would authorise
        `git reset --hard` inside a copy somebody may be keeping precisely
        because it is not the original.

        **Be exact about what that weaker path proves, because it returns before
        `remote_url()` is ever reached.** It never asks git anything: its whole
        evidence is a `.git` directory plus a file at `CLAIM_FILE`'s name whose
        JSON has this version, this item id, and some other folder's
        `install_id()`. It does NOT establish that the checkout is a checkout of
        the manifest's repository. Writing such a file needs local write access
        to this exact path under a server directory, which is inside the trust
        boundary already, and it is not a new asymmetry — the `OWNED` path is
        origin-blind for the same reason and by the same design (the claim is
        its own corroboration). Recorded so the next reader does not mistake
        "this app's own handwriting" for "this is the right repository".

        `None` is the adoption; anything else is the fact that stopped it, which
        the caller turns into that fact's own sentence. Which fact, and which of
        its answers, is the whole of what a refused user needs to hear — see
        `_NoAdoption`.

        The gap this narrows: a module installed by a build older than the claim
        file has no claim, so the first Install after that change is refused. A
        migration on `origin` alone would have undone the guard exactly — a
        matching `origin` is what EVERYBODY with this catalog entry has, and
        "the user's own checkout of the right repository" is the case the guard
        was written for.

        **It does not close that gap for every existing user, and the commit
        that introduced it said it did.** A module whose upstream ships no
        `include.sh` gets one written by `install()` itself; that file is
        untracked; fact 3 asks about the whole tree; so exactly those modules
        fail adoption and their users still get the refusal and its remedy. The
        behaviour is right — see the paragraph on untracked files below — but
        the claim was overbroad, and this is where a reader will look for it.

        Four independent facts, and a hand-installed module fails one of them:

        1. `origin` names the repository the manifest does (established by the
           caller, and passed in so this reads as one rule rather than half of
           one).
        2. `server_dir_claim()` is `OWNED`: `.yulon-install.json`, OUTSIDE this
           folder, at the server dir, says this app CREATED this server
           directory. A user who cloned a module into their own AzerothCore tree
           cannot produce that file, and it is not something a module repository
           can carry — it is not in the folder being adopted at all. This is the
           fact that does the work.
        3. The checkout is unmodified. `git reset --hard FETCH_HEAD` destroys
           exactly the tracked changes `status` reports, so an empty answer is a
           proof that adopting costs nothing, and `None` — git could not be
           asked — is not that proof and refuses. It refuses under its own
           name (`TREE_UNSEEN`, not `EDITED`): nobody established that this
           checkout has anything uncommitted in it.
        4. HEAD carries no commit the update would not. **`status` is not this
           question and cannot be made into it.** It compares the working tree
           and the index against HEAD; it says nothing at all about what HEAD
           itself is. A user who cloned this catalog's own repository into a
           directory this app created and then COMMITTED their customisations
           has a perfectly clean tree, passes facts 1-3, and the update that
           adoption authorises — `fetch` + `reset --hard FETCH_HEAD` — moves
           HEAD off those commits and leaves them reachable only through the
           reflog. So the fourth fact asks git the question the third one only
           looks like: `rev-list FETCH_HEAD..HEAD` is empty, after
           `no_local_commits()` has run the update's own fetch to put a truthful
           commit behind `FETCH_HEAD`. `None` — git could not be asked, or the
           fetch could not reach the remote — refuses, per `Ownership`'s three
           outcomes: "nothing to compare against" is not "nothing to lose". It
           refuses as `HISTORY_UNSEEN` rather than `COMMITTED`, because the
           commonest way to reach it is a machine that is offline, and telling
           somebody who has committed nothing that their commits are in the way
           would be the collapse this fact was added to end. `branch` is the
           manifest's, because the manifest's is what the update will fetch.

           **This fact costs a network round trip, and that is why it is asked
           last.** It runs only once facts 2 and 3 have both said yes, moments
           before the install fetches the same refs anyway; an offline machine
           gets a refusal for an install that could not have proceeded. Its
           first version compared against `refs/remotes/origin/<branch>` and
           `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`, and the second of those is never
           refreshed by the branchless `fetch origin HEAD` this app runs — so
           one legitimate update made every already-updated module look like the
           user's own work and refused exactly the population the fact exists to
           let through. `git.RunnerGit.no_local_commits()` carries the
           measurement.

           This is the third time in this codebase that a question with more
           states than the answer being carried has produced a bug (see
           `native.read_claim()`'s absent-vs-unreadable collapse and
           `read_clone_claim()`'s note about it). "Clean" and "has nothing of
           the user's in it" are different facts, and only one of them is what
           `status` returns.

        The whole tree, `"."`, not one path, for fact 3: there is no file in a
        module clone this app can point at as the one that matters. That also
        means an UNTRACKED file blocks adoption, which is stricter than the harm
        requires — a hard reset does not delete untracked files — and it is the
        `include.sh` case above. Deliberate, and NOT allowlisted even for that
        one generated name: the file this app writes is empty, a user's
        `include.sh` need not be, so an exact-name allowlist would have to
        become a content check to be safe, and a content check is the first step
        of deciding which of somebody's untracked files are innocent. The
        direction of this error is a re-clone; the direction of that one is lost
        work.
