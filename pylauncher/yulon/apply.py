"""The declarative apply engine: turn a `Manifest` into install/configure/remove steps.

This is the one place the manifest primitives (`source`, `deploy`, `patches`,
`sql`, `conf`, `client`, `server_dbc`) acquire behavior (roadmap 2.3). It is
game-agnostic and shared by every `controller_<acronym>/modules.py`
(style-guide §4); all per-item knowledge comes from the manifest, never from
a conditional here. Everything that reaches outside the process goes through
a small seam (`Git`, `SqlRunner`, `DbcCopier`) so the engine is unit-testable
without git, Docker or a network, and so the real implementations live next
to the other subprocess code.

Nothing is ever skipped silently, and nothing is ever CLAIMED silently either:
every step a run could not perform (no SQL runner, no client dir, no DBC copier)
is named in `ApplyReport.skipped`; SQL left to AzerothCore's own importer is
named in `ApplyReport.pending_sql` rather than in `done`, with the glob resolved
so the file count is one this run took (`PendingSql` records what that cost);
and `rebuild_required` says whether the worldserver must be rebuilt before the
change is live. The engine does not restart, rebuild, or touch Docker itself —
that is the controller's call (call down / signal up, §5).

the install has not finished, which is the state T68 is about: the T7 direct-SQL

remove — a permanent lockout on every clone an older build made, for a key that
says nothing about ownership. So the version stays 1 and this key is read as a
three-state: `False` is this build saying the install stopped, `True` is this
build saying it finished, and ABSENT is a claim written before this key existed.

Absent counts as finished (`clone_install_unfinished()` answers False), and that
is the only reading that cannot make things worse. Older builds wrote the claim
in the same place this one does — immediately after the clone and before
`_deploy`/`_sql`/`_conf`/`_client`/`_dbc` — so an older half-install and an

    directory it was written in. A user hand-installing a module into their own
    AzerothCore tree cannot produce one, and a COPIED server folder carries one
    that names the original's path — so this answers `UNKNOWN` there for the same

    `url` is written for a human reading the file; it is never what ownership is
    decided on, because a URL is what everybody with the same catalog entry has.

    `completed` is `COMPLETED_KEY`'s value and defaults to the honest answer at
    the moment a claim is first written for a NEW clone: the folder is filled and
    none of the install's remaining steps has run. `install()` writes it again
    with `True` once they all have.

    **EVERY call writes the WHOLE record, so a key this call does not carry is a
    key the claim loses.** That is the atomic-rename argument below — a
    read-modify-write would give a torn claim a second chance to exist — and it
    is the one thing a caller adding a field here has to know. It is why
    `install()` reads the claim's current `completed` BEFORE the clone and hands
    it back to the first write (a re-install that fails mid-way must not demote
    a module that was finished), and why the SECOND write is a single call in
    `_finish_claim()` rather than one call per fact: two writes, each carrying
    its own key and defaulting the other's, would leave whichever ran first
    erased. A new fact belongs in this signature as another keyword with a
    default, and in `_finish_claim()`'s one call — not in a write of its own.

    **Written somewhere else in the same directory and then renamed over the
    real name, never straight into it.** A plain write opens `CLAIM_FILE` for
    truncation and then fills it, so a full disk, a killed process or a lost
    power cable at the wrong instant leaves a HALF file at that name — and a
    half file is the worst of the three possible states. It does not parse; a
    claim that does not parse reads `UNKNOWN`; `UNKNOWN` refuses every caller;
    and `remove()`'s relocation licence needs a claim that PARSES, so it refuses
    too. The user is then left with a module this app installed, that this app
    will not uninstall, and no route back that does not involve finding and
    deleting a dotfile by hand. That is a permanent lockout caused entirely by
    metadata this app alone writes and reads.

    `os.replace()` of a fully written file is atomic on POSIX and on Windows, so
    a reader sees the old claim or the new one and never a fraction of either.
    The temporary file has to be in the SAME directory — a rename across
    filesystems is a copy, which is exactly the tearing being avoided — and the
    clone directory is where it goes. It is cleaned up on failure so a refusal
    never leaves debris inside a checkout `git status` will report on.

    `client_files` are T67's receipts for what went into the user's game client.
    They are written by a SECOND call, after the client copy has happened, over
    the claim the install already wrote — the claim has to exist from the moment
    the clone does (a killed install leaves a folder this app must still
    recognise), and the receipts cannot exist until the bytes have landed. The
    two orders of failure both fail safe: a claim with no receipts leaves the
    client file alone, and there is no state in which a receipt exists for a copy

    `applied_by="db-import"` hands a module's `data/sql/**` to upstream's own
    `UpdateFetcher`, which is right — applying those files by hand leaves the
    `updates` ledger without their hashes and a later real import re-runs them.
    But "right to defer" was written down as `done`: until 2026-09-07 `_sql()`
    appended `sql <glob> → <db>: left to ac-db-import on next start` to the done
    list having run nothing and checked nothing, not even that the glob matched
    a file, and `controller_view._format_report()` ticks every done entry. The
    live applier on yulon-ubuntu therefore reported

        DONE: sql data/sql/db-world/*.sql -> world: left to ac-db-import on next start

    over an install where nothing whatever had been applied and nothing was
    going to be: `docker.start_staged()` names the three long-running services
    so a Start never reaches the importer, and `docker.repair_import()` refuses
    a database that is already complete.

    So the deferral is a value now, and it is a value rather than a sentence
    because the caller that has to tell "applied" from "not applied yet" must
    not do it by grepping English — that would be this same defect one layer up.

    `files` is the glob RESOLVED against the clone, so the count a reader is
    shown is one this run actually took:

    * a tuple of clone-relative paths — what is on disk waiting,
    * `()` — the glob matched nothing, which is not an error and is NOT "this
      module has no SQL". Measured on the real clones, yulon-ubuntu 2026-09-07:
      `mod-aoe-loot` keeps its one file in `data/sql/db-world/base/`, one
      directory below the `data/sql/db-world/*.sql` its manifest names, while
      `mod-solocraft` (1 file) and `mod-transmog` (3, plus an `updates/` folder)
      put theirs exactly there. The layout is per-repository and this pattern is
      Yu'lon's own bookkeeping — `UpdateFetcher.cpp:159-186` joins the module's
      `data/sql` path and walks it itself, so upstream applies what this misses.
      An empty answer therefore means "this app cannot count", and the caller
      must not draw it as "nothing to do",
    * `None` — the path carries a `{key}` and this run could not resolve it.
      A third answer for the same reason `docker.importer_sees_modules()` keeps
      one: globbing the raw `{key}` would match nothing and report a confident
      "no files". No shipped manifest has such a path today (all 20 db-import
      steps across 15 manifests are literal `data/sql/db-*/*.sql`), and

        hand since (`battlepass_config`), and an update is not a reason to
        put those back to the prompt defaults.

        either route runs.

        `complete` finishes a DERIVED manifest from the content that has just
        landed; see `Completer`. It runs after the clone or the copy, and
        everything from `_deploy()` onwards reads what it returned.

        `replacing` is the user's answer to `replacement_question()`, and it is

        folder — `update()` asks its own copy of those questions first and the
        second pass here is deliberate: this is the method that reaches the
        clone seam, and a guard that only one of two callers runs is how the
        asymmetry T47 closes came about.

        `_check_values()` is NOT re-run against the completed manifest: it is
        the caller's answers that are being checked, and the fields a completer
        fills (conf files to activate, SQL to report) carry no prompts to

        """Fast-forward this module's clone and re-apply it — refusing anything a reset destroys.

        `install()` over a folder that is already a checkout IS the pull: the
        clone seam runs `git fetch` then `git reset --hard FETCH_HEAD` and
        re-applies the pin, and everything after it — deploy, patches, SQL,
        conf, client files — is what has to be redone once the source has
        moved. So this runs `install()` and does not reimplement any of it.

        **What it adds is the three questions `install()` does not ask, and it
        adds them here rather than inside `_require_own_clone()` on purpose.**
        That guard returns the moment this app's own claim reads `OWNED` —
        before `origin`, before `is_unmodified()` and before
        `no_local_commits()` — and for a FIRST install into a folder this app
        made that is right: there is nothing there to lose, and asking would
        cost a network round trip on every install. For an update the same
        silence is a `reset --hard` over work nobody looked at, which is the
        one thing T44's ticket says must not happen: "a dirty clone is not
        fast-forwarded".

        The three, in the order of what costs least and is most certain:

        1. **The repository.** The update never consults `CloneSpec.url`: the
           clone seam fetches whatever `origin` the checkout already has. So an
           app claim — a JSON file under a path this app can write — would
           otherwise authorise resetting a folder that is a DIFFERENT
           repository and then deploying this manifest's files, patching them
           and running its SQL over the result. A local read (`git remote
           get-url`), so it is asked first and both names go in the refusal.
        2. **The working tree.** `reset --hard` destroys precisely what `git
           status` reports, minus the two files this app itself put in the
           checkout: its own `CLAIM_FILE` (T66 — see `git._status_pathspec()`;
           until it was fixed that one untracked file refused an update on
           every clone this app had ever made) and an untracked, EMPTY
           `include.sh` it touched into a C++ module whose upstream ships none
           (T47 — `git._without_the_generated_include()`, which reads the
           status CODE so that a tracked `include.sh` somebody changed is still
           their work). Also a local read.
        3. **HEAD.** `status` compares the tree and the index against HEAD and
           says nothing about what HEAD itself carries, so a user who
           COMMITTED their work passes 1 and 2. `no_local_commits()` counts
           `FETCH_HEAD..HEAD` after running the update's own fetch, which is
           why it is asked LAST — it is the one that costs a round trip — and
           why it also refuses a remote that has REWOUND and a detached HEAD
           with commits of its own: all three are "HEAD carries something the
           new tip does not", counted the same way whoever put it there.

        `is True` throughout and never truthiness: `None` is "git could not be
        asked", which fails closed and says so in its own words. Telling an
        offline user that they have uncommitted changes is telling them
        something nobody established (`Ownership`'s three outcomes).

        A folder that is not there at all is refused rather than quietly
        installed: the press the user made was Update, and an Update that
        silently installs is a different action wearing the same button.

        **A fourth question for a module that follows its releases (T150):
        would this move it BACK?** Its update resets to the newest release's
        commit, and question 3 asks against the branch -- so a clone newer than
        the release passes all three and is reset backwards.
        `_refuse_a_step_back()` asks it, after the three and before anything is
        changed, and the commit it checked is handed to `install()`, which will
        not reset a checkout that has moved off it since. `approved` is the
        person's own yes to going ahead when neither the clone nor GitHub could
        answer (`ReleaseDirectionUnknown`), and holds for that HEAD and that
        release only (`UncheckedApproval`).

        The three questions, in one place, for the two callers that run that
        reset: `update()` through `_update_refusal()`, and `install()` through
        `_costly_reset()` (T47 — until then only one of them asked, over the
        very same folder). The order is the order of what costs least and is
        most certain, and it is argued in `update()`'s docstring.

        `is True` / `is not True` throughout and never truthiness: `None` out of
        a seam is "git could not be asked", which fails closed under its own
        name rather than telling an offline user they have uncommitted changes.

        Two questions can be switched off, and both switches belong to
        `install()`:

        - `repository=False` is "the user has already been shown the two
          repository names and said replace it anyway". Only that question is
          dropped; the tree and HEAD are still asked, so an agreement to replace
          a DIFFERENT repository is never also an agreement to throw away
          uncommitted work in it.
        - `history=False` is `replacement_question()`, which runs on the GUI
          thread before any job is queued and so may not fetch. Dropping the
          HEAD question there can only make the question ASKED where the
          install would then refuse — a refusal after a Yes, which changes

    def _require_own_clone(self, manifest: Manifest, clone: Path, action: When) -> None:
        """Refuse `modules/<id>` unless this app can show the folder is its own.

        Both destructive paths go through here, and neither had anything before
        (three reviewers, 2026-08-31). `install()` handed the path straight to
        the clone seam, which `shutil.rmtree`s a destination that is not a git
        checkout and runs `git fetch` + `git reset --hard FETCH_HEAD` on one
        that is, without ever comparing its origin; `remove()` deleted it
        outright. The path is not obscure: it is `modules/<id>` under the
        server dir, which is exactly where an AzerothCore user installs a
        module by hand, and the id comes from a catalog this app chose. The
        shipped Modules tab binds "Install selected" to `install()` directly,
        so one press over a hand-made `modules/mod-x` was enough.

        The order is the order of the evidence, cheapest and most certain
        first, and nothing is written before all of it is in:

        0. Nothing at the path: the ordinary first install, and the only case
           with nothing to lose. Allowed without asking git anything.
        1. Not a directory — a FILE at the clone path is somebody's,
           and neither `rmtree` nor a clone may decide what it was.
        2. A directory with no `.git`: hand-installed content, or a tarball
           unpacked there. Refused if it holds anything, allowed if it is an
           empty folder somebody made — there is nothing there to lose.
        3. A checkout this app's own claim vouches for: allowed, and this is
           the ONLY way through. `read_clone_claim()` says why the claim is
           enough on its own here, where `catalog.native` needs its record
           corroborated by `origin`.
        4. A checkout of the right repository with no claim, in a server
           directory this app installed, with nothing modified in it and no
           commits of its own: adopted. `_adoption_refusal()` has the four
           facts, why three of them were not enough, and — when one of them
           says no — which one the user is told about.
        5. Everything else is a checkout this app did not make. `origin` is
           asked only to say WHICH refusal — a different repository, this
           repository, or a git that would not answer — because every branch
           of it refuses. That is the divergence from
           `native.refuse_unowned_checkout()`, which can be reached with the
           question already answered by its caller.

        `UNKNOWN` is refused with its own sentence, per `Ownership`: a damaged
        claim means this app knows LESS than an absent one, so it must not act
        more freely.

        **`action` is here because a refusal's REMEDY is not the same for the
        three callers, and one wrong remedy causes the harm it prevents.** The
        first version said "move the folder aside" everywhere. For `install()`
        that is right and cheap. For `remove()` it is advice to strand yourself:
        moving the clone aside makes `clone.exists()` false, and then this run's
        remove-time SQL and `_undeploy()` either fail outright (an `in_clone`
        patch or an SQL file that is no longer there) or quietly leave the
        deployed files behind — so the module stays half-installed in the
        database with no route back through the app. Every `remove()` refusal
        therefore keeps the user pointed at removing, and says why the folder
        must not simply be made to disappear.

        **Does `remove()` accept weaker proof than `install()`? Yes — one
        specific piece of it, and no more.** The asymmetry is in what a refusal
        COSTS. Refusing `install()` costs the user nothing they had: their
        folder is untouched, and the remedy (move it aside, install again) is a
        download. Refusing `remove()` costs them the only in-app route to a
        clean database, and there is no second one — the rows and the deployed
        files stay, forever, and the folder they were told to move aside is not
        the problem. The relocation case makes that a real lockout rather than a
        theoretical one: `install_id()` is a hash of the ABSOLUTE path, so
        moving or renaming a server folder makes EVERY claim in it read
        `UNKNOWN` at once.

        So `remove()` — and only `remove()` — also accepts
        `claim_written_by_this_app()`: a claim that parses, carries this
        version, names THIS item, and differs from `OWNED` in exactly one field,
        the folder it was written in. That is this app's own handwriting; a
        hand-installing user does not produce it, and a stranger's checkout has
        no claim file at all. What it cannot distinguish is a MOVED install from
        a COPIED one — nothing on disk can — and that is the whole of what is
        given up: in a copy, `remove()` deletes a clone that this app made a copy
        of, for an item the user has just asked to remove. `install()` is not
        given the same licence, because there the same input would authorise
        `git reset --hard` inside a copy somebody may be keeping precisely
        because it is not the original.

        **Be exact about what that weaker path proves, because it returns before
        `remote_url()` is ever reached.** It never asks git anything: its whole
        evidence is a `.git` directory plus a file at `CLAIM_FILE`'s name whose
        JSON has this version, this item id, and some other folder's
        `install_id()`. It does NOT establish that the checkout is a checkout of
        the manifest's repository. Writing such a file needs local write access
        to this exact path under a server directory, which is inside the trust
        boundary already, and it is not a new asymmetry — the `OWNED` path is
        origin-blind for the same reason and by the same design (the claim is
        its own corroboration). Recorded so the next reader does not mistake
        "this app's own handwriting" for "this is the right repository".

        `None` is the adoption; anything else is the fact that stopped it, which
        the caller turns into that fact's own sentence. Which fact, and which of
        its answers, is the whole of what a refused user needs to hear — see
        `_NoAdoption`.

        The gap this narrows: a module installed by a build older than the claim
        file has no claim, so the first Install after that change is refused. A
        migration on `origin` alone would have undone the guard exactly — a
        matching `origin` is what EVERYBODY with this catalog entry has, and
        "the user's own checkout of the right repository" is the case the guard
        was written for.

        **It does not close that gap for every existing user, and the commit
        that introduced it said it did.** A module whose upstream ships no
        `include.sh` gets one written by `install()` itself; that file is
        untracked; fact 3 asks about the whole tree; so exactly those modules
        fail adoption and their users still get the refusal and its remedy. The
        behaviour is right — see the paragraph on untracked files below — but
        the claim was overbroad, and this is where a reader will look for it.

        Four independent facts, and a hand-installed module fails one of them:

        1. `origin` names the repository the manifest does (established by the
           caller, and passed in so this reads as one rule rather than half of
           one).
        2. `server_dir_claim()` is `OWNED`: `.yulon-install.json`, OUTSIDE this
           folder, at the server dir, says this app CREATED this server
           directory. A user who cloned a module into their own AzerothCore tree
           cannot produce that file, and it is not something a module repository
           can carry — it is not in the folder being adopted at all. This is the
           fact that does the work.
        3. The checkout is unmodified. `git reset --hard FETCH_HEAD` destroys
           exactly the tracked changes `status` reports, so an empty answer is a
           proof that adopting costs nothing, and `None` — git could not be
           asked — is not that proof and refuses. It refuses under its own
           name (`TREE_UNSEEN`, not `EDITED`): nobody established that this
           checkout has anything uncommitted in it.
        4. HEAD carries no commit the update would not. **`status` is not this
           question and cannot be made into it.** It compares the working tree
           and the index against HEAD; it says nothing at all about what HEAD
           itself is. A user who cloned this catalog's own repository into a
           directory this app created and then COMMITTED their customisations
           has a perfectly clean tree, passes facts 1-3, and the update that
           adoption authorises — `fetch` + `reset --hard FETCH_HEAD` — moves
           HEAD off those commits and leaves them reachable only through the
           reflog. So the fourth fact asks git the question the third one only
           looks like: `rev-list FETCH_HEAD..HEAD` is empty, after
           `no_local_commits()` has run the update's own fetch to put a truthful
           commit behind `FETCH_HEAD`. `None` — git could not be asked, or the
           fetch could not reach the remote — refuses, per `Ownership`'s three
           outcomes: "nothing to compare against" is not "nothing to lose". It
           refuses as `HISTORY_UNSEEN` rather than `COMMITTED`, because the
           commonest way to reach it is a machine that is offline, and telling
           somebody who has committed nothing that their commits are in the way
           would be the collapse this fact was added to end. `branch` is the
           manifest's, because the manifest's is what the update will fetch.

           **This fact costs a network round trip, and that is why it is asked
           last.** It runs only once facts 2 and 3 have both said yes, moments
           before the install fetches the same refs anyway; an offline machine
           gets a refusal for an install that could not have proceeded. Its
           first version compared against `refs/remotes/origin/<branch>` and
           `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`, and the second of those is never
           refreshed by the branchless `fetch origin HEAD` this app runs — so
           one legitimate update made every already-updated module look like the
           user's own work and refused exactly the population the fact exists to
           let through. `git.RunnerGit.no_local_commits()` carries the
           measurement.

           This is the third time in this codebase that a question with more
           states than the answer being carried has produced a bug (see
           `native.read_claim()`'s absent-vs-unreadable collapse and
           `read_clone_claim()`'s note about it). "Clean" and "has nothing of
           the user's in it" are different facts, and only one of them is what
           `status` returns.

        The whole tree, `"."`, not one path, for fact 3: there is no file in a
        module clone this app can point at as the one that matters. That also
        means an UNTRACKED file blocks adoption, which is stricter than the harm
        requires — a hard reset does not delete untracked files — and it is the
        `include.sh` case above.

        **Two names `unmodified()` does not count, and the argument this
        paragraph used to make against the second one.** `CLAIM_FILE` is the
        first (T66, `git._status_pathspec()`), and it changes nothing here:
        this method is reached only for `UNCLAIMED`, and the two ways to be
        `UNCLAIMED` are no such file at all and one the REPOSITORY tracks —
        which `status` already reports as unchanged. A claim this app wrote but
        cannot read as its own is `UNKNOWN`, and `_require_own_clone()` raises
        on that before ever getting here.

        The second is an untracked, EMPTY `include.sh` (T47,
        `git._without_the_generated_include()`). This paragraph refused it for
        years on the grounds that "an exact-name allowlist would have to become
        a content check to be safe, and a content check is the first step of
        deciding which of somebody's untracked files are innocent" — and the
        first half was right, which is why it IS a content check and not a
        name. Two conditions, both read from the checkout: `?? ` in the status
        line, so the repository does not track the file, and zero bytes, so
        there is nothing in it to lose. Nothing decides that somebody's file is
        innocent; a file with anything at all in it is counted, and so is one
        the repository tracks, however small. What it buys is the case that
        made the rule wrong: the app touches that file itself, into a folder it
        created, and then refused to update it because of what it had done.

        `ApplyReport.world_stopped`'s only source. Every early return below is
        `False`, because none of them read anything about the world.

        Owner answer 7 (`phase8-parity-decisions.md:44`) is the rule — *no
        direct writes to `characters`/`world` while running; reads are fine* —
        and until this function existed the applier had **no** running-world
        guard on this route at all. Only the `db-import` route was ever pressed
        live (`8.7a-wotlk-yulon-ubuntu-2026-09-08/11-cycle2-up.log`), and that
        route's guard is not here: it is `docker.apply_module_sql()`
        (`docker.py:2029-2036`), which refuses when `spec.world`/`spec.auth` are
        in `_running().ours`. **That guard could not be reused.** It needs a
        `ContainerSpec`, a compose project name and Docker itself, and this
        module's whole contract is that it never touches Docker (module
        docstring, style-guide §3/§5): the applier is called down into and
        signals up. So this is a second ENFORCEMENT POINT for one rule, not a
        second rule — the fact is asked through a seam so the caller can hand
        both routes the same answer, and the sentence deliberately echoes
        `docker.py`'s ("holds ... in memory and saves them back over whatever it
        finds. Press Stop") so a user meets one rule and not two.

        Four decisions, each of which could have gone the other way:

        * **A pre-pass over the action's steps, not a check inside the loop.**
          `all-stackables` sends three statements to `world` on install; a guard
          consulted per statement can let the first through and refuse the
          second, which is a half-applied mod and a worse bug than no guard.
          Nothing has run when this raises, so *no rows written* is true of the
          whole action and not merely of the step that tripped it.
        * **It raises rather than reporting `skipped`.** `phase8-designs/
          c-operators-risk.md` says both — `:90` "refused", `:345` "skipped with
          the step named" — and `checklist.md:2501`, which is the definition of
          done this box ticks on, says *refused ... with the step named and no
          rows written, and applies once the server is stopped*. A `skipped`
          line inside a press that otherwise succeeds is not a refusal: the
          module would end up marked installed with its SQL never applied, which
          is the very defect 8.7a's third clause is about. `ApplyError` is this
          engine's one refusal vocabulary and every caller of `install()`
          already handles it. It also has to be a raise for `remove()`, whose
          SQL is the module's *undo* and whose next statements delete the clone
          holding it — a skip there loses that file forever, and `remove()`'s
          own comment already puts its refusals before the SQL for this reason.
          What the message must NOT claim is that nothing happened: by the time
          `_sql()` runs, `install()` has cloned, deployed and patched. It says
          what is true — no SQL, no rows — and that a second press repeats the
          steps already taken.
        * **`auth` is never a reason to refuse, but an `auth` step alongside a
          refused one does not run either.** Half a manifest is not an outcome
          anyone asked for, and the `auth` write survives the refusal being
          lifted (a second press re-runs it).
        * **The seam absent means the behaviour every caller had before this
          landed, byte for byte** (`c-operators-risk.md:345`). It shipped that
          way: for one day no caller passed `world_running` at all, so
          `_world_running` was `None` on all four games and this function
          returned at its first line — a capability, not a defence. T2's press
          had to attach the seam itself, and recorded that the Modules tab as it
          then shipped would have written 7 219 rows into a live world without a
          word. Every factory the app builds an `Applier` through passes it now
          (T7), and `test_apply.py` enumerates them so the next one added is
          caught rather than discovered.

        Fails closed on anything short of a clear "no": `None` and a seam that
        raises are both refusals, because *could not ask* is not *not running* —
        the same three-valued discipline `docker._running()` uses for a project
        it cannot read.

        The guard above tells a user to stop the server. The app's Stop is
        `docker.stop_staged()`, which takes the whole compose project down —
        database included — and every direct SQL step in this engine is a
        `docker exec` into that container. So the instruction ended in
        `Error response from daemon: container 3c922e8e... is not running`,
        measured through the app's own controls (T2, `4-press-world-stopped.log`).
        That is `bug-checklist §46` — *"there is no compliant way to install a
        SQL mod at all"* — whose title scopes it to CMaNGOS and whose mechanism
        is shared, so it was AzerothCore's too.

        Three decisions:

        * **The world is not started, ever.** Only the database, alone, which is
          the "world down, database up" state §46 says the app had no way to
          reach. Starting the world would put back the very thing the refusal
          above exists to keep away from these tables.
        * **Every `direct` step counts, not only the `WORLD_HELD_DBS` ones.**
          The guard's set is about what a running worldserver holds in memory;
          this is about whether there is a database process to talk to at all,
          and an `auth`-only mod fails the same way on a stopped stack. The
          `when` filter is kept, so a configure over a manifest whose SQL is all
          install-time reaches for nothing.
        * **A failure to start is a refusal, carrying the daemon's own
          sentence.** `docker.start_database()` names the container, the timeout
          and where the logs are; nothing here knows better, and a paraphrase
          would send the operator looking in the wrong place. Nothing has run
          when this raises, for the same reason the guard is a pre-pass.

        Returns whether the start seam was CONSULTED — not whether it started
        anything. `_sql()` re-reads the running-world guard on a true answer,
        because consulting it is what opens the window: the call can block for
        up to three minutes waiting on health (`_DB_HEALTHY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`),
        and the world can come up inside it. `False` here means nothing was
        asked of Docker and no time passed,
        so the first reading is still the current one.

        `dest: interface` copies INTO the shared `Interface/` folder, where this
        app cannot tell its own files from the client's — so neither is worth a
        receipt nobody would act on.

        **WHICH files is read off the SOURCE in the clone, never off a listing of
        the destination, and that distinction is a whole `Data/` folder.** Round 1
        review, 2026-09-16: the first version listed `target` — and for a step
        whose `src` is a DIRECTORY, `_client` copies its contents INTO
        `<client>/Data`, so `target` IS the user's `Data/` folder. It recorded a
        receipt for every archive the user's WoW install has ever had, each
        matching its own hash at remove time, and removing the shipped Season of
        Discovery keg (`kegs/sod.json`, `src: .../Client Files/data`, `dest:
        data`) emptied `Data/`. The source names exactly the files this app
        copied; nothing else can be ours by definition.

        The HASH is still taken from the destination copy, which is a different
        question from which files to hash: same bytes when all goes well, and
        when it does not — a short copy, a full disk — the receipt describes the
        file that is really in the user's game, which is the one `remove()` will
        be comparing against.

        A source file with nothing at its destination, or a copy that cannot be
        hashed, yields no receipt — the same state as an older install's: the
        file stays at remove time and is named. Never fatal: the install itself

        Why an MPQ is deleted and an addon folder is not, when both were copied

    """How far behind each installed module of `server_dir` is (checklist 8.7a).

    Enumerated from DISK, not from the manifest store, and that is the whole
    point: "installed" means a clone is in `modules/`, so a module a user put
    there by hand is listed and a manifest nobody installed is not. It is the
    same enumeration `docker.allowed_modules()` hands the importer, for the same
    reason — the folder is what the server has, and the catalog is only what it
    could have had.

    `branches` maps a module key to the branch its manifest names, because the
    manifest's branch is what an update would fetch. Every module in the
    `wow-wotlk` catalog omits `source.branch`, so the ordinary answer is `None`
    and the ordinary fetch is `origin HEAD` — which is exactly why a wrong
    branch here would go unnoticed until the first module that names one.

    Costs one `git fetch` per checkout, so it belongs behind a control the user
    pressed. Nothing outside each clone's `.git` is written and no working tree
    is touched.

    `releases` maps a module key to the GitHub repository of a manifest that
    says `follow: releases` (T126). Such a checkout is counted against its
    newest release's commit -- the fetch names that commit instead of a branch
    -- and its row carries the release's tag. It is asked AS a release, so a
    checkout newer than that commit, or off its line, is not counted as behind
    it (T150, `git._behind_after_fetch()`).

    **A row a shallow checkout could not settle asks GitHub (T148)** --
    `Behind.UNCOUNTED`, or a release it could not place -- through
    `compare_commits` (GitHub's compare API by default), and shows its answer
    instead: a number, or where the checkout stands to its release. The
    question is about the exact commits git counted, its answer is kept while
    they are the same, a failed ask waits an hour, and a press asks at most
    `GITHUB_ASKS_PER_PRESS` and none after GitHub refuses (`_GitHubCounts`).
    Every other row costs GitHub nothing, and a GitHub that does not answer
    leaves the row saying "update available", as it did.

    - **At most `GITHUB_ASKS_PER_PRESS` asks, and none after a refusal.** A

A direct `.sql` OUTSIDE these directories is therefore never in the updater's
way, and withholding its module -- which is the only granularity
`AC_UPDATES_ALLOWED_MODULES` has -- costs real db-import work for nothing. That
is what it cost live: City Bots' three db-import groups went unapplied because
of its one `playerbots/` file, the world died on `Table 'acore_world.city_bot_poi'

    itself, with its own client, and nothing writes a row into the `updates`
    ledger when it does -- upstream's updater has no way to learn that a file it
    can see has already been run. `docker.allowed_modules()` then handed the
    importer every folder under `modules/`, ARAC among them, so the updater
    opened `arac.sql`, ran it against a world database that already held its
    columns, and the press ended `ac-db-import exited 1, so its modules' SQL may
    be part-applied` over a state this app itself had created.

    **What "in the updater's way" means, and it is per FILE (T78 round 3).** The
    first version of this asked only whether a direct file was under
    `data/sql/`, which is where the updater is pointed rather than what it
    walks. City Bots keeps three db-import groups under the three directories
    the updater DOES walk and one direct file under `data/sql/playerbots/`,
    which nothing joins a path for -- and that one file withheld the module
    whole. Measured live 2026-09-17: City Bots installed with "3 left
    unapplied", the rebuild succeeded, the world aborted on `Table
    'acore_world.city_bot_poi' doesn't exist`, the app printed its own correct
    remedy ("Press Apply module SQL on the Modules tab, then Start"), and that
    button withheld `mod-city-bots`; the world restarted 18 times. A direct file
    outside `IMPORTER_DB_DIRS` is now no reason to withhold anything, and a
    direct file inside one still withholds its module -- that is the only lever
    `AC_UPDATES_ALLOWED_MODULES` offers for a file the updater can see, and the
    module's db-import work is the price. `module_sql_report()` then says which
    file cost it.

    **Why this and not a ledger row.** Recording the direct route's files in
    `updates` was the other candidate and is refused on evidence: nothing in this
    repository carries that table's schema -- no fixture, no SQL file, no compose
    file names one of its columns -- the updater re-checks the hash it stored on
    every later run, and its own refusal says in as many words that applying
    repository SQL with your own client and using the auto-update system are not
    to be mixed. A row written from here would be this app guessing at somebody
    else's bookkeeping, and a wrong guess aborts the NEXT legitimate update
    rather than this press.

    `installed` is the folder listing -- `None` for "could not be read", which is
    the one answer that is not a decision: the plan then changes nothing and the
    press behaves exactly as it did before, which is what
    `docker.allowed_modules()` does with the same `None`.

    A module on disk that no manifest describes is handed over: this app has no
