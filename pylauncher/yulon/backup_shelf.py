"""Deleting and cleaning up old backups from the Maintenance tab (T604).

The backups folder, `<server>/sql_scripts/backups/`, only ever grows: every Back
up now, every update's copy, every Restore's safety copy and every Tortoise
outside item's copy lands there, and nothing took one out. This module is the
tab's way to do that without the player finding the folder by hand, and without
being able to remove the one file that would have saved the server.

**Plan, then act.** `read_shelf()` lists the folder and says, per file, what made
it, what it holds, whether it can be restored and what protects it.
`plan_delete()` and `plan_clean_up()` turn a choice into a `Plan` that names the
files together with the identity (device, inode, size, mtime) of each. Nothing is
removed until `carry_out()` has taken the maintenance lease, read the folder
AGAIN and found every named file unchanged and still unprotected: any difference
refuses the whole thing and removes nothing. A plan shown on screen is therefore
a statement about the folder at that moment, never a permission slip.

**What is never removed** (`kept_because`, each with a test):

* the newest good copy of every database. "Good" is a dump that passes
  `maintenance.verify_dump()` and is not another game's; a cut-short newest file
  or a file recorded for another game is not cover for the older one;
* the newest update copy set (`before-new-build`): the copy "Update the server"
  put back from;
* the newest update copy of each distinct migration state: failed updates keep their sets
  (T633), and a return past a migration needs the copy from before it (T646);
* every file the restore marker names, and ALL files while the marker cannot be
  read (an unreadable marker is a restore in flight that names nothing);
* the earliest `before-<id>` set while `<id>` is installed: it is the undo a
  Remove names;
* anything with a second name (a hard link) -- removing a name frees nothing and
  the other name is not ours to judge;
* anything that is not a regular file directly inside the folder: no links, no
  sub-folders, no walk. A backups folder that leads out of the install is listed
  and never deleted from (`tuning.check_inside()`, the rule Tuning's saves obey).

A file marked read-only is deleted only by an explicit Delete on that file (the
flag is cleared, the file unlinked, and the flag put back if the unlink fails);
a Clean up never touches one.

The Backup button and this share `docker.maintenance_lease()`, so a delete cannot
run beside a dump that is adding to the folder, nor a dump start under a delete,
whether the other job is in this Yu'lon or another one (T568's reservation is
asked first, by `docker.reservation_holder()`, so the refusal can say who).

Not here, on purpose: conf `.bak` copies, record files, and the client pack
asides. They are not database dumps and the Backups box does not list them.
