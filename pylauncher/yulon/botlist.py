"""Browsing this server's bots, one page at a time (Phase 8.5a, 8.5b, 8.5c).

8.1a already counts them. What this adds is the list, and one fact per row that
the count cannot carry: **which signal identified it**. On WotLK there are
two — the playerbots registry and the account-name prefix — and they disagree in
exactly the case that matters. An install whose prefix was changed after its
bots were made has rows the registry knows about and the prefix does not; a
single number hides that, and a person looking for a missing bot has nowhere to
look.

**Only WotLK has two.** The three CMaNGOS trees carry the account prefix and
nothing else, so on those the split is a sentence about nothing: it named the
`playerbots` registry, which those installs have not got, and put a zero beside
it that a person would then go looking for. `has_registry()` is the one reading
of that fact, and both the SQL that attributes a row and the sentence the tab
prints take it from there (8.5b, measured on m910q's TBC install 2026-09-07:
900 bots of 901 characters, the split reading 0/900 on every read).

**Where a marker matching nothing is reachable at all.** On WotLK it is not —
8.5a asked with a marker matching nothing and still got 1000, because the
registry arm answers whether or not the prefix does. On a one-signal tree the
zero is real, and the warning beside it is the only honest output. That path
was exercised against a live server for the first time on 8.5b.

**And a zero has two causes, which had one sentence between them.** The name
filter is folded into the WHERE the total is counted over, so a filter matching
nothing reached the marker warning: the tab blamed a marker that had matched 500
rows a keystroke earlier. `_why_zero` picks the sentence by which question was
asked, and the point is not only that the filtered sentence was false — it is
that the marker sentence is the whole live evidence for the warn clause on a
one-signal tree, and a second cause for the same words would have left 8.5c's
gate unable to say which one it photographed (8.5c, 2026-09-07).

Paged because the owner runs 500 and has said the number is his to raise. Read
live, never cached: the population moves while the tab is open.

**Paged by where the last page ended, not by how many rows to skip.** The list
is read fresh on every press from a table that changes while the tab is open,
and `OFFSET` counts rows: one bot logging out before the boundary shifts every
later page by one, so a row is shown twice and the row that took its place is
never shown at all. A cursor is anchored to a row instead — `(name, guid)`,
which is a total order where `name` alone is not, so equal names cannot swap
places between two reads (adversarial review, 2026-09-07).

The total beside it is still a separate count and can be a moment older than
the rows. That is what a live list is; it is labelled rather than pretended
away.

**The filter is escaped with `!`, not with a backslash.** `NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES`
is a real mode on both MySQL and MariaDB, and under it a backslash is an
ordinary character — so a filter escaped with one silently stops escaping and
starts matching. A name with an apostrophe is a name, and it is doubled rather
than stripped.
