"""Where a family id becomes a class — and nothing else (roadmap 7.1).

`installer.installer_for()` reads `install.native.family` off the entry and
asks here. Adding an emulator lineage is one class in this package and one
line in `FAMILIES`; a game of an existing lineage is catalog data only.

Catalog data that names a family this build has no engine for is a DEFECT and
not a supported window: `family_for()`'s refusal is the only answer, and the
spine's shipped-entry test fails on exactly that state. (F.3 deleted the bash
`Installer` such an entry used to fall back to; G.7 deleted the
`is_registered()` predicate that had called the state a supported window, which
nothing had referenced since that branch went.)
