"""The AzerothCore family: WotLK's stage tuple on the shared spine (roadmap 7.1).

Today's `native.py` bodies, moved verbatim with their names, their evidence
rules and their cancel notes: `clone-core`, `clone-modules`, `generate-compose`,
`build`, `client-data`, `start-db`, `import`, `up`, `ready`. The names are
pinned by a test because a state file written by the 6.3 Windows partial
install (2026-08-25) exists and must still read.

What is AzerothCore-shaped and therefore here rather than in the spine: the
server dir IS the core checkout (source `dest` "."), the modules go under
`modules/`, the server data is fetched by a compose one-shot, and the import
is a compose one-shot gated by the injected `acore_*` probe pair. The probe is
INJECTED by the caller (`install_wiring.py`): this module never imports a
`controller_*` package.
