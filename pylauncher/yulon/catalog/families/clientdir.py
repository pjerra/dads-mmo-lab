"""The client folder: refuse what cannot extract, warn about what usually does not.

`validate()` is pure and returns preflight `Check`s, not questions. The scripts
asked "Continue anyway? (server WILL fail to load maps)" at every doubt; the
engine cannot ask, so each doubt is either a refusal (the folder, `Data/` or
the expansion's own MPQ is missing — nothing can be extracted from that) or a
warning (too few MPQs, no locale folder, the repack smell, a nearly full
drive — extraction usually still works, and the count gate in `extract.py` is
the real check). The build number is reported by nothing here: no script read
it either, and a number the folder cannot prove is not a fact.

Every refusal carries the sentence that gets the user out of it. A refusal is
the end of the road for this install, so one that only says what is wrong
leaves a person with a folder picker and no idea what to put in it.

Per-game data (`ClientSpec`) is the only thing that differs between the three
CMaNGOS clients, so this module holds no game literal — style-guide §3.
