r"""The conf stage kind: patch `Key = value` lines in an emulator's ini-style conf files.

One job, family-neutral: a `ConfPatchTable` from `catalog.json` says which files, which
keys and which values (with `{{TOKEN}}`s), and this module turns that into text. The bash
installers did the same work with `sed`, one expression per key, and the point of
replacing them is to stop doing it approximately.

**A key has three states, not two**, and each gets its own answer here:

* **present and set** (`^Key\s*=`) — REWRITTEN in place, so the file keeps its order and
  its comments. The scripts overwrote every conf on every run, which threw away a user's
  other edits with each reinstall. EVERY active spelling is rewritten, not the first: the
  emulator reads the file top to bottom and the last assignment wins, so a patch that
  stopped at the first would leave the original value in force further down.
* **present but commented** (`^#\s*Key\s*=`) — uncommented in place, and only when the
  patch says `match_commented`. The real `playerbot/aiplayerbot.conf.dist.in` ships
  `AiPlayerbot.SyncLevel*` as `# Key = 0` and nothing else, which is what the Vanilla
  installer's seds were uncommenting; everywhere else a commented key is documentation
  and is left alone. Only the FIRST commented spelling is uncommented — a second is
  usually the upstream default, and live it would win and undo the patch.
* **absent** — appended at the end, because a conf the emulator reads with the key
  missing silently takes a default, which is how a 500-bot install boots with 50.

An active line always beats a commented twin: a file carrying both `# Foo = 1` and
`Foo = 2` is one nobody can reason about, so the comment stays a comment.

There is no fourth state here for a file that could not be READ. `patch()` takes text and
returns text — it never opens anything — so it cannot tell an empty file from an
unreadable one and does not pretend to; empty text is deliberately a conf with no keys in
it, and all of them are appended. The read/unreadable distinction belongs to `_read()`,
below `materialise()` on the side of the seam that does the opening, and it is a
`InstallerError` naming the path — for a file that is missing, is a directory, or is not
UTF-8. That last one needs saying out loud: a `UnicodeDecodeError` is a `ValueError`, not
an `OSError`, so the obvious `except OSError` lets it escape a resume as a raw traceback
about a byte offset in a file it does not name. `_write()` answers to that rule from the
other side and for the same reason — a `UnicodeEncodeError` is a `ValueError` too — so the
two are one decision rather than two.

**Where a conf comes from, and what is never done to it again.** `materialise()` copies
the image's `*.conf.dist` out ONCE per file and strips the suffix; `apply_table()` patches
what is there, in place, and writes only when the bytes change. A file that exists is
never re-copied, because by then it may be one the user has edited — which is the whole
reason this module patches rather than doing what the bash installers did, which was to
overwrite every conf on every run.

**Line endings are the subject, not a detail.** The two real files a single CMaNGOS
install patches disagree: `mangos-classic`'s `mangosd.conf.dist.in` and
`realmd.conf.dist.in` are LF, and `playerbots`' `aiplayerbot.conf.dist.in` is CRLF
throughout. So a hard-coded newline is wrong for one of them, and half-wrong is a file
with mixed endings — a real defect, and one this project has already come within a commit
of shipping twice. Every existing line keeps the ending it arrived with, and a line this
module INVENTS takes the ending of the file's first line.

Tokens go through `composegen.fill`, the one `{{TOKEN}}` grammar in the app (contract A6),
so an unknown token is an error rather than a literal `{{DB_HOST}}` in a conf file that
the emulator would then try to connect to.

These files are written by the HOST user and read by the server INSIDE the container, so
the mode here and the `USER` in the Dockerfile are one question answered in two places.
Today the answer lines up: `wow-*/native/Dockerfile.tmpl` declares no `USER` and
`shared/cmangos/*.yml.tmpl` carries no `user:` key, so `mangosd` is root and root bypasses
POSIX permission checks — a host-owned `0600` conf is readable anyway.

Widening it was considered and refused: the file holds the database password in clear text
(`LoginDatabaseInfo = "host;port;user;password;schema"`), which is exactly what a mode is
for, and widening it now to protect against a change nobody has made would be paying the
real cost for the hypothetical one.

What the trap deserved instead is being loud. A future hardening pass adding a non-root
`USER` is an ordinary, well-intentioned change; it would make every conf unreadable to the
server, and the symptom is "it will not boot" with nothing pointing at a constant three
modules away. `test_the_conf_mode_stays_owner_only_only_while_the_images_run_as_root`
reads the shipped templates and goes red the moment one of them stops running as root, in
the same commit that does it, naming this constant. That is the "one place" the two facts
answer to, short of moving the mode into the catalog beside the Dockerfile — which is a

    ONE `docker cp` of the whole `source_dir` for however many files are missing — a

    round trip at all when nothing is missing, which is the resume case and the common
    one. That check comes first for a reason beyond speed: a resumed install may be
    running against an image that is no longer on the machine.

    A file that already exists is never touched. By the second run it may be one the user
    has edited, and re-copying would throw that away; patching it in place is
    `apply_table`'s job.

    All or nothing. Every missing `.dist` is checked before ANY of them is moved, because
    a loop that moved as it went would leave the earlier files behind on a table the image

    would sail straight past them into a half-built `etc/`.

    The whole-directory copy carries one constraint, measured rather than assumed (Engine
    29.6.2, Windows 11, ordinary account): `docker cp` recreates each entry of the tar it
    extracts, and creating a SYMLINK on Windows needs a privilege a normal account does
    not hold — so one symlink anywhere in `source_dir` fails the copy, and the conf files
    beside it do not arrive. Upstream is safe today: `mangos-tbc`'s `mangosd` and `realmd`
    `CMakeLists.txt` install every conf with plain `install(FILES ... ${CONF_DIR})`, and
    the one `install(DIRECTORY ...)` beside them targets `BIN_DIR`. If that ever changes,

    resume ever repairs — `materialise()` will not re-copy a file that exists, so the
    server reads the surviving half, silently takes defaults for everything past the cut,
    and boots looking healthy.

    The rename is within `path`'s own directory so it is atomic, and the mode is asked
    for at CREATION rather than set afterwards. `newline=""` for the same reason `_read`
    has it: text mode on Windows would turn every `\\n` into `\\r\\n` and convert an LF
    conf on a developer's machine.

    **What the mode buys, and what it does not.** This docstring used to say the conf "is
    never readable by anyone else even for an instant (the database password is in it)".
    That was false in both directions, and it was the more dangerous kind of false: a
    guarantee written down stops the next reader checking.

    Measured on PKGAME-LAPTOP, Windows 10.0.26200, CPython 3.13.14, 2026-09-01, by K.3
    while writing the sibling `_write_secret`: on **Windows** the POSIX mode is a complete
    no-op. `os.open(..., 0o600)`, `open()` + `os.chmod(0o600)`, and a plain `open()` all
    produce `st_mode & 0o777 == 0o666` with byte-identical `icacls` output, and under a
    folder granting `BUILTIN\\Users:(RX)` the file is readable by every local account. A
    following `chmod` changes neither mode nor ACL, so no rearrangement of these calls
    buys anything there.

    On **POSIX** the mode is real, but the old code did not get it: it wrote with `open()`
    and chmodded AFTER, so the temp file held the password at the umask default until the
    chmod landed. That window is now gone — `os.open` applies the mode in the creating
    syscall, the same way `cmangos._write_secret` does. Corrected 2026-09-02; the window
    was read off the code rather than raced, so no timing measurement is claimed.

    So this is a POSIX guarantee and a Windows no-op. Making it true on Windows needs an
    explicit DACL (`pywin32`, or `icacls /inheritance:r /grant:r`) on every path that
    touches the file — a decision about the app's Windows security posture, not about this
    function, and `cmangos._write_secret` writes the same password under the same limit.

    `UnicodeEncodeError` is caught beside `OSError` for the reason `_read` catches
    `UnicodeDecodeError`: it is a `ValueError` too, so the obvious `except OSError` misses
    it and a resume ends in a raw traceback about a character position in a file it does
    not name — the same defect one function away, given the same answer. It is reachable
    rather than theoretical: `json.loads` accepts a lone surrogate, so a `"\\ud800"` in a
    `catalog.json` conf value survives `fill()` and `_line`'s line-break check (a
    surrogate is not a newline) and arrives here as text UTF-8 cannot encode.

    Caught SPECIFICALLY, not as `ValueError` and not as `Exception`. `UnicodeEncodeError`
    is the only `UnicodeError` a write can raise, so the parent class buys nothing; and
    anything else escaping this block is a bug in the caller or in this module rather than
    a state of the machine — a non-`str` `text` is a `TypeError`, and the `encoding` and
    `newline` whose spelling could raise `LookupError` or `ValueError` are literals on the
    line above. Reporting one of those as "the conf could not be written" would dress a
    seam bug up as a bad file, which is the mistake this project is briefed against.
