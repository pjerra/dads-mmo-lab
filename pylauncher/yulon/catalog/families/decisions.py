"""Every place the code branches on a server family, and what each family gets there (T179).

Before T179 most of these sites read `if family == "azerothcore": … elif family ==
"cmangos": … else: nothing`. Two families filled both arms; a third falls into the
`else` at every one of them, and the feature is simply absent, with nothing
failing. This registry is where that cannot happen silently: each site names, per
family in `NativeInstall.family`, one of

* `supported` -- the site serves this family (its own branch, or a default that is
  right for it);
* `not-available: <reason>` -- the feature is deliberately not offered on this
  family, and `reason` is the sentence a player is told;
* `not-applicable: <why>` -- this family never reaches the site (it sits inside
  another family's engine, reads another family's block, or the family keeps the
  same fact somewhere else), so there is nothing to offer or withhold;
* `pending: Task N` -- `trinitycore` only, while T179 is being built: the site
  will serve it, in the plan task named. Allowed only while no entry of the
  shipped catalog has `family: trinitycore` (`pending_problems()`), so a
  Centurion entry cannot ship while any site still owes it a branch.

`tests/test_family_decisions.py` holds it: every site decides every family, and an
AST scan of `yulon/` finds every family branch -- any string constant equal to a
family's name outside a `Literal[...]` type, a family block's attribute, a keyword
named after a family, an isinstance or `case` on a family's class, a load of a
module constant bound to a family's name, a method called on `.family` -- and
fails for one that is not a site here. Each scanned site pins the kinds of the
hits it was decided on (`hits`), so a branch added inside a registered scope is
red until somebody decides it. A few sites branch on an id or a data field the
scan cannot see; they are listed with `scanned=False`, and the test keeps their
scopes from rotting.

A site is a scope -- `module` and the qualified name of the def or class holding
the branch (`<module>` for a top-level one) -- not a line, so it survives edits.
Data only: no import of the code it describes.
