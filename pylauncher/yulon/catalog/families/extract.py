"""Client extraction: one `docker run --rm` per tool, and the evidence that lets a resume skip it.

The model is the Tortoise script's, adopted for every CMaNGOS game: the client
is mounted read-only at `/client`, `<server_dir>/data` read-write at `/out`,
the container's cwd is `/out`, and on Linux it runs as the invoking uid:gid
(`platform.container_user_args()`). Nothing is ever written into the user's
client and nothing is `chown`ed afterwards — the two things the TBC script's
`ExtractResources.sh a` model needed `sudo` for.

Evidence lives in `data/.yulon-extract.json` and a tool is skipped only when
three things agree: a completion record for THAT tool (name + argv hash,
written only after an exit status the plan calls success), every `produces` directory
holding at least its
threshold of files, and the stage-level facts (plan hash, client path, the
required file's size and mtime) matching what this run would write. The
record is what makes the cancel note true: `ad` killed after 100 of ~700 dbc
would otherwise pass the count gate on resume and be skipped with a partial
set; the stage facts are what make a resume pointed at another client extract
everything again even though every count passes.

**Three answers, one bit.** "Has this tool already run?" is asked of a
filesystem, and a filesystem has a third answer to everything: an evidence file
that will not open, one that will not parse, a `stat()` on the client that
raises. `tool_satisfied` returns `bool`, so each of those has to be walked to a
side on purpose. They all go to **False — run it again**, because the two
mistakes are not the same size: a needless re-run costs an hour of somebody's
evening, while a wrong skip hands them a half-extracted client that looks
finished and fails later, in a server log, as missing maps. Nothing that was
merely *not disproved* is ever allowed to license a skip.

That principle is why `Evidence` carries `client_facts_complete` as well as the
facts. `required_file_size = None` means two different things — "this game names
no required file" (Tortoise until T521: the client path was the only identity) and
"a required file was named and could not be measured" — and stored as two
`null`s they compare equal, so a run whose `stat()` failed would write a claim
that the NEXT failing run reads as a match. The flag keeps the states apart and
`satisfied()` refuses the skip on either side of the comparison carrying it.

not nothing either: these tools parse MPQ and WDT files, which are untrusted
binary input from a client somebody downloaded, and a memory-safety bug in a
C++ archive reader is the oldest bug there is. Both flags are free against a
tool that reads a folder and writes another one:

* `--network none` — nothing in an extraction plan resolves a name or opens a
  socket, the image has no entrypoint script, and a payload that got in through
  a malformed archive has nowhere to send anything. If a tool ever did want a
  network the failure is immediate and legible, not silent.
* `--security-opt no-new-privileges` — one of the two protections `container_t`
  was providing for free until `container_security_args()` turns it off with
  `label:disable` (`git.py` records the same pairing for the same reason). The
  tools exec nothing, least of all anything setuid.

**`--cap-drop ALL` and `--read-only` are deliberately NOT here.** Both change
what the process may do to the filesystem it must write — `--read-only` its own
root, `--cap-drop ALL` its ability to write a bind mount whose permissions do
not already allow it — and on Linux `platform.container_user_args()` has already
reduced the process to the invoking user, which is where most of `--cap-drop`'s
value would have come from. What is left is Docker Desktop, where the tool runs
as the image's root and where none of this can be measured from a test suite.
`docker.ContainerRun` records that they are unmeasured against these tools;
adding them on that footing would be shipping an install-blocking risk to buy
back very little, and `security_args` is where a measured set lands later.

    **The SELinux half is a correctness fix, not defence in depth.** Measured on
    `yulon-fedora-gate` (Fedora 44, Enforcing, Docker 29.7.2, 2026-09-01): a
    confined container is DENIED the user's game client outright. `data/` is
    fine without any label, because `stage_generate_compose` relabels the server
    directory and `data/` is created under it afterwards and inherits
    `container_file_t` — but the client is the user's own folder, somewhere else
    entirely, and no `chcon` of ours ever reaches it. `:z`/`:Z` are not the
    answer and must never be used on it: they RECURSIVELY relabel their source,
    which here is somebody's game install, and that is the same reason
    `docker.bind_mount_ok()`'s probe bans them. `label:disable` read the client
    and left its context byte-identical, and let `data/` be written as well.

    So this is one flag for the whole run rather than a suffix per mount: the
    container holds both the folder it must not touch and the folder it must
    write, and `platform.label_disable_args()` — `git.py`'s read path already
    asks it — keeps the three answers three. On "could not ask" nothing is

For a tool that insists on cwd = client and writes beside `Data/`: `cp -rs` lays
symlinks to the read-only mount in a folder of the container's own writable
layer (gone with `--rm`), the tool runs there, and whatever it produced is
copied to `/out`. The client mount stays `:ro` — the point of the whole model —
and the argv's `/client` paths are rewritten to `/work` so the tool reads
through the farm. Data, not code: `stage_client: true`.

Three details are load-bearing and each of them is a wrong sentence avoided:

* **The farm's own failure is not the tool's.** `mkdir`, `cp -rs` and `cd` are
  one chain, and if any of them gives up the script says so in its own words and
  exits `STAGE_FAILED_RETURNCODE` WITHOUT running `"$@"`. `_conclude()` then
  says the tool never ran, rather than reporting a status the tool never
  produced.
* **The copy-back is by content into a folder we make.** This bullet used to say
  the plan's `cp -r "$name" /out/` nests as `/out/Buildings/Buildings` on a
  second pass. **It does not, and that reason is withdrawn.** Re-measured
  2026-09-01 on `debian:stable-slim` (GNU coreutils) and `alpine:3.20`
  (BusyBox), running the plan's script twice against one persistent `/out`:
  both merged flat into `/out/Buildings/`, identically. A relative source with
  an existing destination *directory* derives `dest/basename(src)`; only
  `cp -r "$name" "/out/$name"` nests, which both images also confirmed and
  which nothing here ever proposed. Anyone who meets `cp -r "$name" /out/` in
  an older draft should know it is not known-broken.

  The shipped spelling stays on two grounds that survive the re-measurement. It
  is idempotent across passes by construction rather than by a convention of
  `cp`'s about trailing components, so the invariant is visible in the line
  instead of in a manual page. And it is the only one that puts a `produces`
  name containing a slash where the count gate looks: measured the same day, a
  `produces` entry `Cameras/Buildings` lands at `/out/Buildings` under the
  plan's form and at `/out/Cameras/Buildings` under this one, while `counts()`
  reads `data_dir / folder` — so the plan's form would refuse that install for
  having produced nothing. No catalog entry names a slashed folder today and
  nothing in `ExtractTool` forbids one.
* **`$status` is the tool's.** Saved before the copy loop, so a `[ -e ]` that
  found nothing cannot turn a failed extraction into a success, and a successful
  extraction whose output folder is missing still reaches the count gate as
  "produced too little" rather than as a shell error.

    """Run every tool the evidence does not vouch for, recording each as it finishes.

    `client_files` is for a `client_dir` that is a view of the player's client
    (T260), handed to `tool_run()`; the evidence then names the player's client
    through `evidence_client_dir`.

    `evidence_client_dir` and `evidence_salt` are for a client that is MOUNTED
    from one folder and IDENTIFIED by another (T179): the TrinityCore family
    extracts from a temporary copy of the player's client with its server's
    packs laid in, deletes the copy afterwards, and makes a new one on a press
    that has to extract again. The evidence names the player's own client
    (`evidence_client_dir`, whose required file the copy shares) and the packs
    (`evidence_salt`, folded into the plan hash), so a resume can be vouched for
    before any copy is made, and a changed pack re-extracts. Both default to
    the mounted client and no salt, which is what every CMaNGOS install records.

    The evidence file is rewritten after every successful tool, not at the end,
    so a Stop between tools loses nothing — that is the cancel note's whole
    claim. Evidence written for another client or plan is replaced at the
    start: its records are worthless, and keeping them would let a count that
    happens to pass skip a tool that read the wrong archives.

    `required_file` is the client spec's; `client_build` is only spoken, in the
    shortfall refusal, because the count gate is the real check of the build.
    `client_named` replaces that clause where the client the player gives is not
    the build the server names (T179 final round: Centurion's realm is 12342, which
    only its ready-to-play copy reports; the player's own client is a stock 12340).

    Every tool the evidence does not vouch for is asked one question
    (`blocking_output()`) in a single pass BEFORE the first of them is run:
    would it refuse to start into the folder that is there? Only `vmap extract`
    can answer yes, and only over a `Buildings/` that still holds `dir` or
    `dir_bin`. That state is not hypothetical -- it is what a finished install
    looks like the moment its evidence file is deleted, which is what
    `cmangos.py`'s patch refusal used to tell people to do. Measured on m910q
    2026-09-05 through this function: without the question the press died at
    the container with "Your output directory seems to be polluted, please use
    an empty directory!", the re-created evidence recorded `dbc and maps`
    alone, and every later press died the same way with no folder ever named.
    Nothing is deleted for the user here; the refusal names `data/Buildings`
    and stops before the container.

    The pass is what makes the refusal's own last claim true. Asked per tool
    inside the loop, as it was when the check was first written, the plans'
    `ad`-first order meant a refused press had already run a container to
    completion and rewritten the evidence file -- under a sentence saying
    nothing was run and nothing was changed.

    Two of the plan's fields are fallbacks, and both are said out loud rather
    than done quietly, because "it needed help" and "it went fine" are different
    facts about somebody's machine:

    * **`retry`** — the vanilla extractors crash on some maps and succeed on the
      next attempt. When a failure's log matches the recipe, the tools the recipe
      NAMES run again, once for the whole plan, and the log says which and why.
      A second matching crash is not retried again: it falls through to the
      refusal, which says it was already the retry. A crash that does not match
      is never retried and nothing in the log mentions one. Each re-run tool's
      output folders are EMPTIED immediately before it runs and said out loud
      first (`empty_out_dirs`), because the vanilla vmap extractor refuses to
      start unless its output folder is empty and the crashed attempt had filled
      it — measured on m910q, 2026-09-04, where that was the whole of why the
      retry could not survive the crash it exists for.
    * **`stage_client`** — `tool_run` wraps the tool in `STAGE_SCRIPT`. The
      wrapper is per-tool and invisible here, except that a farm that could not
      be built is reported as "the tool never ran" rather than as a status the
      tool never produced.

    `selinux_enforcing` is the seam for the one question here that is asked of
    the machine. It is resolved at call time rather than bound as a default, so
    a test that patches `platform.selinux_enforcing` is actually seen — the trap
    `platform.container_user_args()` records against itself — and it is asked
    exactly once, before the first container, for the reason
    `container_security_args()` gives.

    Raises:
        InstallerError: a tool failed, was cancelled, could not be started at
            all, or exited 0 with too few files.

    Five endings, kept five, because the sentence differs for each and four of
    them are not "the extraction failed":

    1. **Stopped.** `CANCELLED_RETURNCODE`, or a cancel token that was set while
       the tool was exiting (`run_attached()` only reports the sentinel while it
       is still reading, so a tool that finished in the same instant comes back
       0 — recording it and marching on would start the NEXT tool after the user
       said stop).
    2. **Never started.** No docker CLI to run at all. "The tool failed" is a
       sentence about a tool that ran; nothing did, and the help text is the
       whole answer. `docker.cli_missing_run()` owns that shape, both halves of
       it, because `docker run` returns the CONTAINER's status and a binary
       missing inside the image genuinely exits 127.
    3. **The staged farm could not be laid.** `stage_client` only: `STAGE_SCRIPT`
       gave up before `"$@"`, so the tool never started and the status is one no
       tool produced. Both halves of the signal are demanded, and only for a plan
       that actually stages — a tool is free to exit 91 on its own and to print
       whatever it likes while doing it.
    4. **Failed.** Its exit status and its last words, which is all we know —
       plus, when this attempt WAS the one retry the recipe asks for, that fact.
       "vmap extract failed (exit 139)" is equally true of the first crash and
       of the second, and a user who reads it after a second attempt they were
       not told about goes looking for a first one the message never mentions.
    5. **Finished and fell short.** Exit 0 with too few files: an incomplete
       client, the wrong expansion, a `data/` emptied by hand — or a folder
       nobody could list, which `file_count()` deliberately walks to "too few"
       so nothing is ever skipped on evidence nobody read. That is right, and it
       leaves the CAUSE unknown, so the refusal names both possibilities rather
       than accusing the user's client of a permissions problem in our own
       output folder.

    Only the fifth counts the folders, and it counts them once: the numbers in
    the refusal are the numbers the gate read, and so are the ones in the
    caller's "done" line.

recipe in the catalog can reach it (`wow-tbc` has none; `wow-vanilla`'s fires
on `Segmentation fault|core dumped` and returncode 139).

The condition is a CHECK and nothing here writes either path: see `DIR_BIN`
and `DIR_INDEX` for who writes what, re-read on yulon-fedora 2026-09-05 at
both revisions. `dir_bin` is appended from the first tile; `dir` has no writer
under `contrib` at all.

It is the ONLY one of the four tools that refuses a non-empty output folder,
and that was read again rather than assumed, on yulon-fedora 2026-09-05 at
both pinned revisions (`~/cmangos-probe9`). None of the other three refuses,
and none of them REBUILDS everything either, which are different facts:

* `contrib/extractor`'s `ad` creates its folders with `CreateDir()`
  (`System.cpp:109-116` at 8ec338a1, `:98-105` at f82e7d67) and overwrites
  what it writes -- `.map` files and every extracted client file go through
  `fopen(.., "wb")` (`System.cpp:783` and `:890` at 8ec338a1, `:772` and
  `:879` at f82e7d67). It has ONE output-path `FileExists()`, on
  `Cameras/` (`:972` at 8ec338a1, `:973` at f82e7d67), and it `continue`s past
  a camera file that is already there. Its other `FileExists()` calls are
  about the CLIENT's MPQs;
* `vmap_assembler`'s `main()` is a couple of dozen lines with two `return 1`s,
  both for a bad argv or a failed `convertWorld2()`
  (`contrib/vmap_assembler/vmap_assembler.cpp:30` and `:44` at 8ec338a1, `:30`
  and `:43` at f82e7d67 -- the same two branches, one line apart because TBC's
  assembler is not heap-allocated), and `TileAssembler` opens every output with
  `fopen(.., "wb")` (`src/game/vmap/TileAssembler.cpp:111,162,338`, those three
  line numbers identical at both revisions);
* `contrib/mmap`'s `MoveMapGen` has no such check either, and it does not
  overwrite: `MapBuilder::shouldSkipTile` (`MapBuilder.cpp:1186` at 8ec338a1,
  `:1204` at f82e7d67) opens the existing `mmaps/<map><y><x>.mmtile`, reads its
  header, and returns true -- SKIPPING the tile at `:603`/`:610` -- when the
  magic, the Detour version and the mmap version all match. A tile that is
  missing, short or stale is rebuilt; a matching one is kept. No user of this
  module sees the difference, because the mmaps stage wipes `mmaps/` itself
  when no finished record vouches for it.

A `git grep -i` for "polluted", "dirty" and "empty directory" over
`contrib/mmap`, `contrib/extractor` and `contrib/vmap_assembler` at both
revisions returns nothing. So `vmaps/`, `mmaps/`, `dbc/` and `maps/` need no
emptying for a second extraction, and a remedy that told a user to delete them
would be charging for work the tools do not ask for.

    and rewritten the evidence file the user had just been told to delete.

    -- a pre-`patch-sources` install and a finished modern one -- both logged
    "compiling" and "The build finished." exactly four log lines above this

    (the four patched extractor sources, `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, three
    compose files, `.env`, `.yulon-install.json`, and `.db_password` -- the
    fixture carries none, so the press mints one; an earlier count said 11 and
    omitted it); the modern one left 1 (`.yulon-install.json`). Re-measured by
    the round-10 review (`.notes/gates/doodad-2026-09-05/round10-press-probe.txt`).
    Neither launched an extraction container and

    The same three-part rule as `run_plan`, asked of the evidence file the
    extract stage wrote — with one difference that has to be said out loud,
    because it makes a whole class of check useless here. This stage reads no
    client, so it has no independently measured facts to compare the file
    against: it passes `current` as BOTH the evidence and the expectation.
    `same_stage()`'s four fields therefore agree by construction and can refuse
    nothing. What can refuse is `satisfied()`'s `client_facts_complete` veto (a
    bit written by whichever run could not measure the client, read back off the
    file), the record for THIS argv, and the counts. Whatever notices a swapped
    client, it is not anything in here: it is `run_plan`, which replaces the
    whole file — this stage's record included — when the stage facts move.

    Without a record the folder is wiped first. The premise is MoveMapGen's
    behaviour — it skips maps it already finds output for — which is the 7.3
    plan's stated reason for the wipe (2026-08-26) and is NOT re-measured here;
    if it is ever measured false, the wipe stops being justified and this is the
    paragraph to come back to. Taking it as given, generating over a folder left
    by an interrupted run produces a permanently partial set that passes every
    later gate, which is the failure this stage is arranged around.

    Deleting is not free, and the order below is what limits the damage:

    * A cancel token that is already set is answered BEFORE the wipe. That is
      the one ending where "do not remove it" costs nothing, so it is taken.
    * A removal that fails refuses on the spot. The alternative — carrying on
      over a folder that is still there — is the exact failure above.
    * The four endings that can follow a wipe (stopped, never started, failed,
      too few files) each say `MMAPS_CLEARED_NOTE` when the wipe happened and do
      not when it did not. A user whose docker CLI vanished between two stages
      is told they are now short a folder, rather than being left to find out.

    `required: false` (data) turns a shortfall into a warning AND records the
    run, so an optional stage that produced little is not regenerated on every
    resume. The threshold for the skip test is then 0; `min_files` is only what
    the warning names.

    The counts after the run are taken once and the gate, the refusal and the
    done line are all made of that one walk, for `counts()`'s reason.
