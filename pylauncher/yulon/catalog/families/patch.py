"""Tolerant application of a unified diff to a cloned checkout: the `patch-sources` stage kind.

Why this exists at all is `pyplan/upstream-cmangos-doodad-drop.md`: a defect in
CMaNGOS's `vmap_extractor` drops 14.8% of a Vanilla world's placed collision
geometry on every case-sensitive filesystem, silently, and §10 of that page
recommended carrying the fix as a patch applied after `clone-sources`, against
pinned revisions, until upstream takes it. The CMaNGOS family binds this module
at `patch-sources`; the patch file itself ships as data beside the family's
compose templates and the catalog names it per entry.

**Why not `git apply`.** The clone seam is containerised `alpine/git` on Linux
and the host's git on Windows, and the state of a checkout after a failed apply
differs between the two (`git apply` is atomic per invocation; `patch(1)` is
not, and is not on every box). Applying in Python makes the outcome the same
on every platform, makes "already applied" a first-class answer rather than a
`Reversed (or previously applied) patch detected!` prompt, and keeps the
refusal sentence in this module's hands. The patch file stays a real unified
diff so the same bytes are what the upstream report attaches.

**Tolerant, in exactly two ways, and strict in every other.** A hunk whose
pre-image is found (once) is applied, at the stated line or at an offset from
it — an unrelated line added above the function moves the context without
changing it, and refusing every install over that would be the wrong trade. A
hunk whose pre-image is absent but whose post-image is present (once) is
already applied and is left alone — that is what makes the stage survive the
day upstream lands their own fix, and what makes a resume safe whether or not
the state file says the stage ran. Anything else refuses, naming the file and
the line the patch expected, and NOTHING is written: every hunk of every file
is resolved before the first byte goes to disk, so a patch that half-applies
cannot leave a checkout that half-compiles.

**Which question is asked first, and why it is not always the same one.** For a
hunk that removes at least one line, the pre-image is the test: applying it
destroys the pre-image, so finding it means the work is still to do. For a hunk
that removes NOTHING the pre-image is pure context and applying it leaves that
context intact, so the post-image has to be asked about first or an insertion at
the head or the tail of its own block applies again on every press. Measured
2026-09-05 before the order was fixed: three presses of a `+int d;` hunk left
three copies of `int d;`. Every hunk of the patch this module ships removes
nothing, so this is the ordinary path here rather than a corner of it.

"First" is AT THE HINTED LINE, and the distinction is not pedantry -- it was a
defect for six hours the same day. Asked of the whole file, a post-image that
occurs anywhere beats a pre-image sitting exactly where the patch said, and the
site the patch named is reported as already carrying the fix and never touched
(measured: `int a;/int b;/int c;/ZZZ/int a;/int b;/int c;/int d;` came back
`(0, 1)` and unchanged). The whole-file question is still asked, and still
answers "present" -- but only after the hinted line has been ruled out as an
unpatched site, which is what keeps an already-applied hunk at an OFFSET (a
second hunk in a file whose first one inserted lines above it) from doubling.

What "found once" costs: a pre-image that matches in two places is ambiguous
and refuses, even though `patch(1)` would take the first. The hunks this ships
carry six lines of context and there is no second `fixedName =
GetPlainName(origPath.c_str());` in that tree, so the strictness is free
today, and the day it is not is a day someone should be looking at the file.

Line endings are the file's own: a checkout is compared and rewritten with
the terminator it already uses, and the patch's lines are matched without
theirs. `git.py` clones with `core.autocrlf=false`, so in practice the files
are LF on every platform, but a CRLF file is a case the tests drive rather
than an assumption the module makes.
