"""The TrinityCore-lineage install engine (T179): one class for every `trinitycore` entry.

Centurion (a TrinityCore 3.3.5 fork) is the first such entry; the facts each stage
rests on are in `.notes/tickets/T179-centurion-facts.md` (CENTURION @ faac5fc9) and
the stage list is the T179 spec's §1. Like `cmangos.py`, the class names no game:
every parameter is the entry's typed `install.native.trinitycore` block.

**Why it is a `CmangosInstaller`.** Six of its eleven stages are stage kinds the
CMaNGOS engine already runs and proves -- the generated database password and the
refusal that guards it, the Dockerfile written from this repo's template with the
secret kept out of the build context, the conf table patched over the image's
`.dist`, the marker-gated SQL plan with its probe, reset, verify and marker -- and
a TrinityCore block carries exactly the same shapes for them (`TrinityCoreData`'s
parts subclass `CmangosData`'s). So this class inherits those bodies and views its
block through `_data()` as the CMaNGOS shape, with no source patches. What differs
is overridden here, by name:

* `stages()` -- its own tuple: no `patch-sources`, no `extract`/`mmaps` (the movement
  maps run after the server is up, Task 4), and `client-data` in their place;
* `_clone_sources()` -- the core checkout is sparse (`sparse_exclude`);
* `_client_data()` -- the temporary extraction client, the tree's DBC overlay and
  the start check, all new;
* `_conf()` -- the conf table alone, without the CMaNGOS bot-count carry-over and
  the Tortoise bot dashboard (`families/decisions.py` records both sites);
* `_expand()` -- every run of the SQL plan, with the database-name renames;
* `after_ready()` / `before_rebuild()` -- the spine's hooks: the movement maps start
  as a background job once the server is up, and stop before any rebuild route
  (`families/mmaps.py`, Task 4).

* `check_moved_sources()` / `servers_down_work()` / `after_update()` -- the update
  route's hooks (Task 6): what the move changed in the tree's SQL snapshot is read
  before the compile (a change to the characters' or accounts' layout refuses the
  update), the changed world tables are imported again with the rebuild's servers
  stopped, before the new build starts (and the old ones again on a rollback), and a
  change to the DBC files or a required client pack flags the map data for
  `reextract()`. A world update that did not finish is finished by the next update
  or by `finish_world_reimport()` (fix round 1).

The inherited "database updates" and corrections presses see a plan with no
re-runnable and no correctable phases, because `native.update_phases()` and
`correction_phases()` read a CMaNGOS block only: this family's SQL moves with its
code, and "Update the server to latest…" is where a change to it is applied.

    flag cleared before it can be deleted, a flag every hard link shares -- it puts
    the flag back on that file. `.yulon-left-out/Data/patch-4.MPQ` maps to nothing in
    the player's client, so the flag would stay cleared on the player's own
    `Data/patch-4.MPQ`. Back at `Data/patch-4.MPQ` it maps to it, as every other
    archive does. A rename changes no flag.

    A name already at the path is a required pack's file, laid in after the archive
    was moved aside (a pack installs over the name the player's own patch had left
    empty); it is the copy's own, never the player's, and it goes first. A
    `.yulon-left-out` that is itself a link (or a junction) is never walked: it was
    not made by this app, and walking it would rename files somewhere else.

    Returns None when nothing is left aside, else what stopped it -- and then the
    copy must NOT be removed.
