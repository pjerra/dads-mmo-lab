"""Install options, errors, the engine protocol and the one dispatch (roadmap 3.1 → 7.2).

Until Phase 7 this module drove one catalog entry's bash `install-*.sh` on a
pty and answered its prompts from a rule table. 7.2 deleted that lineage — the
scripts, the rule table, the responder, the bash probe — and every entry now
installs through a family engine on `native.StagedInstaller`. What is left is
deliberately small: what the user decided (`InstallOptions`), what can go
wrong (`InstallerError` and its subclasses), how a folder is recognised as
holding an install (`compose_file()`), what a view can drive (`InstallEngine`),
and `installer_for()`, the ONE place a catalog entry becomes an engine.
Nothing in this module runs a subprocess or prompts.

`platform_names()`/`unsupported_platform_message()` stay because the engine's
preflight words its off-platform refusal with them; `docker_unavailable()` and
`provision_lines()` stay because the engine reports provisioning with them, and
they live here rather than in `native.py` so that the sentence a user reads
about Docker has one author; `cancelled_install_message()` stays because
`catalog_view.py` shows it after Stop, and `generated_compose_files()` beside
it because that copy's "Use existing…" half turns on which compose files the
engine itself wrote — a different question from `compose_file()`'s, and one
this module was answering with `compose_file()` until 2026-09-05. The copy asks
BOTH: `compose_file()` is what `attach_existing()` gates on, so it is what
decides whether the folder can be adopted at all, and a message that told the
user to delete a folder the app would adopt was the cost of asking only the
other one.

    means the group join RAN and succeeded — the engine is installed and the
    account is a member — and the only thing between the user and a working
    install is that a process cannot acquire a supplementary group it was
    granted after it started. Telling them Docker "could not be set up
    automatically" is the opposite of what happened, and it is the first thing
    this engine ever says to them (live Ubuntu gate, press 1, 2026-08-30:

    Three things are easy to imply and all three are false. The app has not
    remembered the folder — which it did until this existed. Stopping undoes
    nothing and tidies nothing away. And terminating the compose client does not
    stop a build that had started: BuildKit finishes the step it is on inside
    the daemon. That last one is deliberate rather than a wart — those layers
    are cached and are what makes a second attempt cheap — so the copy says so,
    because a message implying an instant halt is what sends someone to `docker
    builder prune` to tidy up, throwing away the hours it would have saved
    (`phase6-decisions.md`).

    What it deliberately does NOT promise is that files are there. Both
    outcomes were measured on the same machine on the same day: cancelled after
    the source clone finished, 2.3 GB stayed; cancelled 1.3 s in, `git` removed
    its own half-written target and the folder was gone. So the copy points at
    the folder and lets the user look, rather than asserting a state it cannot
    know (install gate, 2026-08-23).

    **The advice below is two independent halves, and each is decided by the
    thing that actually gates it.** They were one split on `compose_file()`
    until the 7.10 widget-cancel run drove the whole path with real clicks
    (yulon-ubuntu 2026-09-05, `pyplan/gates/7.2-ubuntu-2026-09-05/`): 15 checks
    green, and a modal that got both halves wrong on the folder in front of it.

    *"Use existing…"* is offered when, and only when, `compose_file()` answers.
    That is not a preference: `attach_existing()` gates on exactly that reading,
    so an offer made on anything else is an offer the app then refuses.
    `generated_compose_files()` chooses the WORDING, and it took two goes to get
    that division right. The 7.10 split asked `compose_file()` alone and so
    fired on the `docker-compose.yml` the clone stage brings down with the
    source (`widget-cancel-folder-after.txt`: that file, nothing built, and a
    modal telling the user to adopt it — which `attach_existing()` would have
    done, growing a tab for a server that did not exist). `2a4f0cab` moved the
    offer onto `generated_compose_files()` and was worse in the other
    direction: a folder with `.git`, `src/` and an UNMARKED
    `docker-compose.yml` — a bash-era install, a hand-written compose file,
    anything from before 7.2, since nothing before 7.2 marked what it wrote —
    got no offer at all and was told to delete itself, while `attach_existing()`
    would have adopted it. It also left `ours` deciding an offer on its own, and
    `ours` does not imply `compose_file()`: `docker-compose.override.yml` is in
    `composegen.COMPOSE_FILES` and not in `COMPOSE_FILENAMES`, so a folder
    holding a marked override and no base rendered "nothing is lost" and
    "Delete <dir>" in consecutive sentences
    (`test_the_app_never_says_nothing_is_lost_about_a_folder_it_names_for_deletion`).
    That folder shape has NO install that produces it, and the branch for it
    says so: `composegen.write_plan()` walks `(BASE_FILE, OVERRIDE_FILE,
    BUILD_FILE)` in that order and always writes or keeps the base first, so
    the only route is a base file deleted by hand. Measured, not assumed — and
    then re-measured, because the first measurement stopped being true of the
    commit that shipped it. With `raise AssertionError` as this branch's body,
    the whole suite on m910q 2026-09-05 (`__pycache__` purged both sides,
    `pytest -q -p no:randomly`) is `2 failed, 2565 passed, 9 skipped`, and BOTH
    entrants are tests: this branch's own
    `test_the_app_never_says_nothing_is_lost_about_a_folder_it_names_for_deletion`
    and the 40-shape sweep
    `test_no_folder_shape_is_offered_adoption_and_deletion_at_once`, whose
    marked-override/no-record shape lands here. 2576 tests were collected;
    nothing among the other 2574 reaches this branch. Run twice: once on the
    content this paragraph was written against, and once on `e4fcc17e` — the
    commit that carries it, minus this sentence — which is the checkout to
    reproduce it from, and gave the same three numbers and the same two names.

    That paragraph said "the single entrant was the test written for it" and
    quoted `1 failed, 2562 passed, 9 skipped` until 2026-09-05 — a run taken
    three tests before the sweep in the same commit existed, and written into
    the commit that falsified it. The number moved, the conclusion did not: no
    production path enters here. It stays because a hand-deleted base is a
    folder a person can be standing in front of, and the alternative render for
    it is a flat "Delete <dir>" over this app's own files.

    **A record does NOT prove the folder began empty, and the copy said it
    did.** The unmarked-compose wording puts two readings to the user —
    installed before this attempt, or brought down by this attempt's clone. For
    a few hours on 2026-09-05 a branch here claimed `native.STATE_FILE` settled
    that, on the ground that `_claim_before_writing()` writes one only when
    `started_empty` is true and that the one non-empty folder `_claim_folder()`
    lets past — a `.git` — is stopped at the clone by
    `refuse_unowned_checkout()`. Measured on m910q 2026-09-05, that is false
    for three of the four shipped games. `wow-tbc` driven through
    `CmangosInstaller.run()` into a folder holding a user's own `.git`,
    `my-notes.txt` and `docker-compose.yml`, Stop pressed after
    `clone-sources`: the record was there and the modal told the user their own
    file "came down with the server's source". `_run_one()` writes the record
    after EVERY recorded stage, `started_empty` or not, and
    `refuse_unowned_checkout()` only ever sees the server dir when a source's
    `dest` IS the server dir — `"."`, which of the shipped entries only
    `wow-wotlk` spells. TBC, Vanilla and Tortoise clone into `src/`, so nothing
    asks about the folder itself at all.

    **The discriminator is the family's clone layout, so the family is an
    input.** Hence `entry` where this took a display name until 2026-09-05.
    Where a source lands in the server dir itself, an unmarked compose file
    there with a record beside it did come down with the clone on every route
    the ENGINE can take, and the routes were enumerated rather than waved at.
    The clone itself is one: upstream's `docker-compose.yml` is a git-tracked
    file of `mod-playerbots/azerothcore-wotlk`, read off a real install in
    `pyplan/gates/7.2-ubuntu-2026-09-05/widget-cancel-folder-after.txt`. A
    checkout already in the folder is the other, and
    `refuse_unowned_checkout()` refuses one before any stage records anything
    (`test_the_clone_artefact_reading_is_given_only_where_the_clone_lands_there`).
    A THIRD route is outside that enumeration and this branch reads it wrong:
    the user's own hand. Delete this app's marked compose files from a finished
    `wow-wotlk` install, drop an unmarked `docker-compose.yml` in, press Install
    — it resumes on the record — and press Stop, and the modal says their file
    "came down with the server's source". Not driven on 2026-09-05 and its
    window is unmeasured, because the same fact that makes route one true means
    a resumed clone stage may overwrite the dropped-in file before the cancel is
    read. Filed in `pyplan/checklist.md` as the route not covered rather than
    left here as one that cannot exist: the sentence said "the only other way
    into that folder is a checkout" until 2026-09-05, and an absolute is what
    this whole docstring is a record of getting wrong.

    Where no source lands there, nothing this attempt downloads can put a
    compose file at the root, so it was already there and the adoption is the
    right offer, record or no record
    (`test_no_source_of_a_shipped_game_is_cloned_into_the_server_dir_except_wotlks`).
    Only the first case with no record leaves two readings nothing on disk
    separates, and there both are said and the user looks.

    The engine defect underneath this is not the copy's to fix and is not fixed
    here: `_claim_folder()` exempts any folder holding a `.git`, and only a
    `dest: "."` family redeems that exemption at the clone, so a CMaNGOS
    install runs to completion inside a user's own checkout (measured the same
    day; `pyplan/checklist.md`). Both branches above stay true whichever way
    that is closed, because neither reads the record for emptiness.

    *"Press Install again"* is offered on the same record, which is not implied
    by source on disk: a folder can hold a whole checkout and no record. What
    the copy must NOT do is explain that with a story about `clone-core`. It
    used to say a clone still running when Stop was pressed "takes that record
    with it", which is a defect being described as a design — the record is
    removed at the START of `clone-core` on every fresh install, whether or not
    anyone presses Stop, because `_clone_core()` clones into the server dir and
    the seam empties a destination it is about to clone into
    (`test_the_clone_that_fills_the_server_dir_takes_the_ownership_record_with_it`).
    A message is not the place to file that.

    **The refusal names the check that actually stops the folder in front of
    it.** Two different ones, and the copy gave both of them the git reason
    until 2026-09-05. With a `.git`: `refuse_unowned_checkout()`, whose reason
    IS fetch-and-reset over a checkout that may be yours — measured, `python -m
    yulon.install_wiring wow-wotlk --server-dir …` exited 1 with "there is
    already a git checkout of … and there is no record here of an install this
    app made" (`cycle2-pressA2-refused-existing-checkout.log`). Without one:
    `_claim_folder()`'s "is not empty and was not created by this app", raised
    in preflight, where there is no checkout to fetch and nothing to reset. Both
    are driven at a call site in
    `test_the_engine_refuses_the_folder_a_cancelled_clone_leaves`.

    **"nothing is lost" and a deletion never appear in one message, and one
    shared reading is what used to put them there.** `2a4f0cab` argued the pair
    was impossible because `adoptable` decided both the offer and the delete;
    deciding both on one reading is exactly what makes them SIMULTANEOUS.
    Measured on m910q 2026-09-05 on a folder holding a marked
    `docker-compose.yml` and no record — the shape a user reaches by deleting
    `native.STATE_FILE`, which is what the UNKNOWN refusal tells them to do —
    the render carried "nothing is lost" and "delete <dir>" two sentences
    apart. The rule is now on the SENTENCE, not on a reading:
    `promised_nothing_lost` is the first branch's own condition, named once,
    and the remedy names a deletion only where it is False. Asserted over every
    reachable folder shape rather than on the one that was reported, in
    `test_no_folder_shape_is_offered_adoption_and_deletion_at_once`.

    With the record there the resume is real and was measured the same night:
    "Using /home/pk/gate72-cycle2 (resuming)", "Already finished: clone-core,
    clone-modules, generate-compose" (`cycle2-pressB.log:26`).

    The pre-7.2 wording is gone for good and must not come back. The bash
    installer's line 961 found no built worldserver image, took the
    existing-folder branch, asked "Remove it and start fresh? (y/n):" — and
    `PROMPT_RULES` answered "n", because `InstallOptions.reinstall` was False and
    nothing in the GUI ever set it. The script printed "Keeping existing install
    — exiting." and exited 0, which the view read as a SUCCESS: it pinned a
    compose project name into a half-cloned folder and remembered a server that
    did not exist. 7.2 deleted that engine.

    One rule since 7.2, read from `catalog.json` rather than from what OS this
    is (style-guide §3): `install.native.family` names the engine, through
    `families.family_for()`. The platform is NOT consulted here — every family
    engine runs on every platform, and an entry that does not support this one
    (`install.platforms`) is refused by the engine's own preflight, from the
    one place that words it (`unsupported_platform_message()`). That keeps the
    refusal on the worker thread with the rest of preflight, where the view
    already expects it (`catalog_view.start_install()` calls this factory
    synchronously and never expects it to raise for a shipped entry).

    Until 7.2 there was a second rule and a third state. An entry with no
    `native` block ran its bash script, and an entry whose family THIS BUILD
    had no engine for fell back to that script rather than being refused —
    a bridge that existed because catalog data arrives before the engine that
    reads it, and it did between G.4 and K.8. K.8 registered `cmangos`, which
    left every shipped entry dispatching to a family engine and the fallback
    reachable by nothing; F.3 deleted the script it fell back to. An entry
    whose family is unregistered now gets `family_for()`'s "install family this
    app does not have" sentence, which is what that state has always been.

    An entry with no `native` block cannot be given an engine at all: there is
    no family to name. That is a catalog-authoring error, not the user's, so it
    is raised here rather than deferred; `test_catalog.py` pins that every
    shipped entry with a non-empty `platforms` carries a `native` block, so the
    app's Install button — disabled off `platforms` — cannot reach this branch.
    The CLI harness (`install_wiring.main()`) can, and catches it (exit 1).

    `import_probe`/`reset_unfinished` are per-game seams the CALLER supplies
    (`install_wiring.py` wires `controller_wow_wotlk.repair`), because
    `catalog/` must not import a controller package.

    Imported inside the function on purpose: `native.py` imports this module
    for `InstallOptions` and the error types, so naming it at module scope
    would be a cycle. The alternative — a fourth module holding three
    exceptions and a dataclass — buys nothing but an import.
