"""The install spine: named, resumable stages, game-free (roadmap 6.2 → 7.1).

One typed engine for every server on every platform. `StagedInstaller` owns
what is true of every install — the state file and its hint semantics, the
directory/ownership guard, preflight and Docker provisioning, the
refuse-not-delete clone safety, the compose marker rules, streaming, cancel
copy, keep-awake — and a FAMILY (`families/azerothcore.py`, `families/cmangos.py`)
composes its stages into an ordered tuple. `installer.installer_for()` picks
the family from `catalog.json`'s `install.native.family`. Every family engine
has the same contract (`run(options, *, cancel, ask) -> Iterator[str]`), so the
catalog view, the log panel and the job runner need no changes.

**Staged and resumable.** The stages are recorded by NAME in
`.yulon-install.json`, so reordering them can never re-interpret an existing
install. The rules below each cost the earlier Rust launcher an evening
(`pyplan/rust-prior-art.md` §1), and they are the reason this file is more
careful than its length suggests:

* preflight and the guard are not stages: the spine runs them itself, so a
  family can neither forget nor record them — a guard a resume skips is not a
  guard. A `Stage` with `recorded=False` (`start-db`, `up`, `ready`) is run by
  every resume: an install must end by actually starting and verifying the
  server, and the database must be back up before the import can ask it
  anything.
* **The state file is a hint, and disk evidence answers in both directions.**
  Every stage re-checks disk evidence before skipping: the clone stages ask git
  for the remote, the build asks the daemon for images, compose generation
  reads its own marker. An `is_done` short-circuit once let a state file
  dropped into a directory make the generator rewrite a real server's compose
  file and orphan its character volumes. The converse is just as load-bearing
  and was missing until 7.1: a stage that is recorded AND corroborated must be
  a genuine no-op, because "re-run it to be sure" is destructive for a clone —
  see `StagedInstaller.already_cloned()`.
* `install_id` is a hash of the ABSOLUTE server directory, so a COPIED install
  directory is refused rather than adopted; `family` is recorded too, so a
  catalog edit that moves a game between families is a refusal, never a
  reinterpretation.
* A failure mid-stage records nothing, so the stage re-runs.
* A stage's cancel note is said by the spine, right after `--- <name>`, and
  by nothing else.

**Nothing on this path prompts for its own decisions.** Exactly two questions
pass THROUGH it, both inside Docker provisioning before stage 1 and both via
the forwarded `ask`: the docker-group consent and, on Linux, the sudo password.
A stage that turns out to need an answer is a design failure to fix rather
than a dialog to add.

**Verified where, exactly.** Everything here is unit-tested against seams;
docstrings say which claims are inherited from the Rust launcher's incidents,
which are measured on yulon-ubuntu (Linux), and which are merely written.

"""What a Stop costs, said before it is pressed, and true of every stage.

The sentence this replaced was about the build (see `BUILD_CANCEL_NOTE`) and
was said as the second line of every install and appended to every
cancellation, so a user who stopped during the clone or the download was told
Docker was finishing a build step (review, 2026-08-23).

**This sentence has been rewritten until every clause names something a stage
is responsible for keeping, because each version claimed more than the engine
does.** It said "only the step that was interrupted runs again" while the live
Ubuntu gate (2026-08-30) printed `Already finished: clone-core, clone-modules,
generate-compose` and ran all three, each doing `git fetch` + `git reset --hard
FETCH_HEAD` over the user's source. It said the source was "left exactly as it
is on disk", which is false of `docker-compose.yml` — a TRACKED file of the
emulator checkout, carrying this engine's marker after the first install, so
`composegen.write_plan()` puts it back whenever it differs. It said only the
last steps run every time, while `start-db` sits mid-list with `recorded=False`
and `client-data` consults no state at all. And it opened with "nothing is
written outside the folder below", three lines above `Docker setup did:
apt-get update; apt-get install -y docker.io; systemctl enable --now docker;
usermod -aG docker pk` — a reassurance printed directly above the actions
contradicting it, which is the exact shape of the sentence removed from the
clone stage (review, 2026-08-31).

So each clause is now a claim something is responsible for keeping:

* *what goes outside this folder* — the base template's two NAMED volumes
  (`db-data`, `client-data`) plus the built images, which is why
  `preflight.evaluate()` has a check about Docker's data root and not only
  about this drive; `platform.ensure_docker()` for the second item, whose own
  `done` steps are printed a few lines below this one; and `config_dir()` for
  the third;
* *finished cloning is never fetched, reset or moved* — `already_cloned()`, and
  `refuse_unowned_checkout()` for the checkout that was never this app's;
* *the build is not run a second time once Docker confirms its images* —
  `stage_build()`, where an unknown answer rebuilds rather than skips;
* *the compose files this app writes are put back* — said, not hidden, because
  `write_plan()` really does overwrite an edit to a file it wrote;
* *the download resumes and re-checks itself* — the generated entrypoint's
  `curl --continue-at -` plus its data-version comparison;
* *the database and server are started and waited for* — the three
  `recorded=False` stages, which is why a resume always ends with a live server.

old build and the rest on the new -- a server nobody has run, reported as if
it were one thing. Giving the new build its own name BEFORE any tag moves is
what makes a failure part-way undoable: the refs already moved are moved back
onto this name, and "the tags still name the new build" is then true of all of
them. Removed once the restore has settled either way.

**Letting it go takes two attempts, and that is measured rather than defensive.**
The first runs the moment the tags are back, while the containers made FROM the
new build are still there, and docker refuses to remove a name whose image a
container references -- so on `yulon-ubuntu2`, 2026-09-09, exactly the two
long-running services came back `conflict: unable to delete ... (must be forced)
- container 31769acad1c4 is using its referenced image` while the two one-shots
(whose containers were not recreated at all) were removed and their images
deleted. Half a broken build kept for ever under a name documented as transient
is not a state anybody chose, so `_restore_rollback` asks again after its own

def rebuild_opening_note(*, renders_dockerfile: bool, parked: bool = False) -> str:
    """What a rebuild costs and what it leaves alone, said before the first stage.

    `OPENING_NOTE`'s counterpart, and a separate sentence rather than a reuse
    because almost none of that one is true here: a rebuild clones nothing,
    generates no compose files, fetches no source and runs no import. Its own
    docstring records what it cost to have one sentence claim more than the
    stages keep, so the rule is the same — every clause names something
    `rebuild_stages()` is responsible for, and the list is exactly as long as
    that tuple precisely so it stays checkable.

    It is a function and not a constant because the tuple stopped being one
    length on 2026-09-09: the families that render their own Dockerfile now
    write it again from the current template before compiling (T8), and the
    families whose checkout ships one do not. A single constant would have had
    to claim the re-render for WotLK, where nothing does it, or hide it from
    the three CMaNGOS games, where it is the point of the press — and "this
    does three things and nothing else" is the kind of clause that goes quietly
    false rather than red.

    The downtime clause is the one a user is most likely to be surprised by and
    is the reason it is stated twice: here, and in `rebuild_confirmation()`
    before they agree to it.

    **"stopping ... leaves the server you have now exactly as it is" is a
    promise the re-render nearly broke**, and it is kept by code rather than by
    narrowing the words: the stage rewrites two files in the folder before the
    compile, so `rebuild()` reads them first and `_put_recipe_back()` puts them
    back on every failure and every cancel that lands before the containers are
    replaced. Narrowing the sentence to "the containers stay as they are" was
    the alternative and is worse: a user who stops a press would be left with a
    build recipe they never agreed to, and the next compile — which may be
    somebody else's press, hours later — would silently produce a different
    image. A promise this app can keep is cheaper than a caveat every reader
    has to hold.

    **"It does not fetch anything" was false, and said so until T223.** Every
    family builds `FROM` a registry image, and BuildKit asks Docker Hub about
    it at the start of a build -- on Docker Desktop's containerd image store
    even when the image is already here -- and a `RUN` layer whose cache is
    gone downloads its packages again. A Rebuild on yulon-win11 (2026-10-04)
    failed in seconds on a Docker Hub TLS timeout under a note promising it
    would fetch nothing. What stays true is narrower: no new source code.

    Three facts and no fourth, and every one of them is a fact rather than a
    reassurance -- `installer.rebuild_confirmation()`'s rule, applied to a
    press that is strictly more dangerous than a rebuild:

    * *what it is* -- code nobody has tested with this app. Said first and said
      plainly, because it is the whole difference from the Rebuild button beside
      it, which recompiles the commit the gates ran on.
    * *what it costs* -- `MEASURED_BUILD_TIMES`, the same citation the rebuild
      quotes, because it is the same compile.
    * *how it can fail, and what survives* -- the build is put back; what the new
      server wrote into the database on its first start is NOT. That second half
      is the recommendation the owner asked for, stated as the reason the offer
      of a backup exists rather than as advice with nothing behind it. It is
      true because `rebuild()`'s rollback covers images and `_put_sources_back()`
      covers the checkout, and neither of them covers a schema migration a
      worldserver ran at boot.

    `rewritten` are `rewritten_line()`s (T126): one per source whose newest
    release sits on history upstream rewrote. They are the only part of this
    question that is not always the same, and the press moves such a source
    only if its line was here.

    It names the repository being fetched from, because "the newest code" is not
    a thing a user can look at and the repository is: the sha in the log
    afterwards belongs to that repo, and so does the issue they will file.

    The sentence lives here rather than in the view for the reason every user

    glob.** A dialog reading `sql/character_updates/*.sql` while the press
    streams three named files is a promise about a pattern; the caller hands
    this the same `expand()` output the run will stream, so the two cannot
    disagree about which files exist or about the order they go in.

    Two facts a user cannot see and would be right to fear, and both are stated
    rather than fixed — this control puts a button on the route T11 built and
    changes nothing about what that route applies:

    * **A file can be refused, and the press stops on it.** Every flagged phase
      ships `on_error: fail`, and the case that is known to be reachable is
      `MODIFY money INT(10) UNSIGNED` against a `guild_bank_money.money` that
      has gone negative: MySQL's strict mode will not narrow it, and the client's
      own last line names the file (T11's reviewer, note 2).
    * **The marker does not move.** A marker row says the whole PLAN finished,
      and one written after two of its phases would tell every later press
      something it can never take back. So no marker is written here and no
      `verify` rule is re-asked; the row already there goes on reading
      `imported`.

    A clone that predates the directory these phases name does not reach this
    function at all: `expand()` refuses first, in `sqlplan._matches()`'s own
    words, which name the pattern and the folder and say the sources may not
    have cloned completely (note 4). That sentence is not wrapped in a second
    one here — it is already the sentence a user reads.

    bug-checklist §41's gate asks for "a log line saying why it was left alone",
    and each clause here is one of the things a reader needs to act on it: the
    address, so the sentence is searchable in a log next to the §35 ones; the
    date the choice was made, because a file holding one word and no date
    cannot be told from a leftover; the file, so the choice can be found and
    deleted without this app; the consequence, because a person reading an
    install log months later may not remember what they picked; and the way
    back, spelled as the two buttons that do it.

    Past tense on purpose (`was left`, `was chosen`): it records what this run
    did and what a person did before it, both of which stay true. The sentence
    it replaced in an earlier draft said the row "is" the loopback, which stops
    being true the moment anyone presses Apply with another mode.

    "no other machine can reach this server" was read against the machine on
    2026-09-06 and kept. It is loose: the mode changes the address the row hands
    out, not what is bound. On yulon-ubuntu at 06:27:43 +02:00, on the install
    the 04:43 loopback Apply had run against, `docker ps --format
    '{{.Names}}\t{{.Ports}}'` printed `ac-authserver 0.0.0.0:3724->3724/tcp` and
    `ac-worldserver … 0.0.0.0:8085->8085/tcp`, and `ss -ltn` printed LISTEN on
    `0.0.0.0:3724` and `0.0.0.0:8085` — so another machine still connects and
    logs in, and is then told the world server is at 127.0.0.1, i.e. on itself,
    so it cannot play. Kept rather than reworded because this exact string is
    what the closing-step gate driver asserts
    (`.notes/gates/bug41-loopback-2026-09-05/closing_step_driver_b41.py:121`)

      the update -- the full 40-character sha. Recorded rather than read back

    Removing the duplication rather than testing for it was the choice, because
    a cross-module equality test is one more thing to keep and it can only

    "Spelled ONCE" is true of the DEFINITION and not of the bindings, and the

    silent no-op rather than a failure; patch the module that spends it, or

    It takes the field NAME rather than a `Field` so a caller with only a

and nothing looked again. Measured live on 2026-09-16 (gate `t63-owed-live`,
WoW WotLK + mod-city-bots): the world initialised in 1 m 21 s, printed
`... ready...`, and one line later aborted on `[1146] Table
'acore_world.city_bot_poi' doesn't exist` — the module's db-world SQL had not
been applied — then crash-looped three times, while the panel read "The server
is up" and "WoW WotLK was rebuilt and is running".

Sixty seconds because of what that same log says happens after the banner. The
line straight after `ready...` is `[mod-city-bots] loaded 219 city POIs`: the
first database work of the running world starts within a second of the banner,
and in the failing run that query is the one that aborted. The work that
follows it — 500 bots logging in, ten to a line — is the rest of the post-banner
startup, and it is tens of seconds long. A minute covers both with margin.

It is an upper bound, not a wait: `watch_after_ready()` returns the moment the
world is seen to have gone, so only a server that stays up spends the whole
minute, and what it costs that server is one extra minute of being watched
before the app says it is up — said out loud, in `wait_for_ready()`'s own
announcement, rather than as a pause.

Deliberately NOT long enough to cover the whole second boot of a crash loop

1.868 today: 2763 / 1479, the widest gap between two adjacent boots in

— `pyplan/checklist.md`, under 7.7 — because it is a policy argued from
evidence rather than a measurement, and the owner may want it wider, narrower,
or replaced by a fourth run.

THE ARGUMENT. Round 4 put the floor exactly on the slowest sample, and a review
answered it in one line: 3703 s is refused. A bound with zero margin over a
single sample of a noisy quantity is a bound that will refuse the first healthy
boot slightly slower than the one boot anybody happened to time. The three
measurements are the only thing available to size the margin with, and what
they show is the spread ACROSS the servers this project ships on one box and one
share: 1479 -> 2763 -> 3702, a factor of 2.50 end to end and 1.87 between the
widest-separated neighbours. So the margin is the widest gap the evidence
actually exhibits, applied once above the slowest thing in it — i.e. the next
server, or the next box, is assumed to sit no further above Tortoise than TBC
sits above Vanilla.

WHAT IT DOES NOT MEASURE, said plainly: nothing here is run-to-run variance.
These are three DIFFERENT servers, timed once each; nobody has booted the same
server twice on 9p, so the project has no number for how much one server varies
between runs, and this margin is a stand-in for a quantity that has never been
measured. That is the weakness the owner is being asked to rule on, and the way
to close it is a second run of one of these three rather than an argument.

WHY NOT THE INSTALL CEILING'S RULE. `READY_CEILING_SECONDS` sits 5.8 times
clear of the same slowest boot, and copying that here would bound the 480 s
AzerothCore callers at six hours — the exact collapse of the two ceilings that
`MANAGEMENT_CEILING_WINDOWS` exists to undo. The two bounds answer different
failures: the install ceiling stops a server that talks for ever, and this
floor stops a management wait refusing one that was going to finish.

somewhere: the boots by the stamps and the gate README they are read from, the
margin by the docstring above and the checklist bullet it points at.

6916 is not a multiple of any budget in use (480, 1800, 10800), which is why
the last window of a management wait is a short one — see
`test_a_management_wait_is_bounded_by_the_ceiling_and_shortens_its_last_window`.
That is a consequence, not a reason.
"""

MANAGEMENT_CEILING_WINDOWS = 2
"""How many quiet budgets a MANAGEMENT wait may spend, when that is the larger bound.

The install gets `READY_CEILING_SECONDS`. The two waits are bounded by different
things and collapsing them was a regression: an INSTALL is a long operation the
user started knowing it was long and which streams progress the whole way, and
six hours is there only so a server printing rubbish for ever cannot hang it.
Between 2026-09-04 and 2026-09-05 the management waits took the install's
ceiling, so a call that used to be bounded at 480 s, 1800 s or 10800 s could
block for six hours whatever its caller asked for, and nothing tested the change.

TWO, because two is the whole claim this constant makes: a budget spent once is
not a budget, and that single-shot reading is the bug this lane exists for. It
is not the number that decides any shipped ceiling today, and that is asserted
rather than hoped — `test_the_management_ceiling_is_the_floor_or_the_cap_for_every_budget_shipped`
walks `catalog.json` and fails the day an entry lands in the band
(3458 s < `timeout_s` < 10800 s) where `timeout * WINDOWS` is what answers. At
that point somebody has to own the multiple with a measurement.

HOW FAR THAT GOES, measured rather than claimed (m910q 2026-09-05, this file's
whole test module at each value): 1 is red (two tests, one of them a real-path
wait that goes back to spending the budget once), 2 and 3 are both green, and 4,
5 and 11 are red (the floor-or-cap audit plus the last-window shortening). So
the constant is owned to a band of exactly two values and a docstring arguing
for one of them over the other would be a confident reason with nothing behind
it. The band was a single value, 2, until 2026-09-05: raising the floor to
`MANAGEMENT_FLOOR_SECONDS` moved 1800 * 3 = 5400 s from above the floor to
below it, and a bound nothing reaches is a bound nothing can measure. That is a
real cost of the margin, recorded here rather than left for the next reader to
find with a mutation.

WHO ACTUALLY CALLS ONE. Not the Server tab's Stop/Start buttons: an earlier
version of this docstring rested the size on them and they do not wait —
`yulon/ui/controller_view.py:998` and `:1006` call `controller.start` and
`.stop`, neither of which asks whether the server came up. Measured 2026-09-05
by grepping the tree: outside `native.py` and `docker.py` every `wait_ready` /
`wait_server_ready` is a definition or prose, and the only code that RUNS one is
`.notes/gates/gate-79-controller-surface.py`, three times per run (lines 219,
414, 487). Its worst case — a server that keeps printing and never says ready —
is therefore three ceilings:

    game          budget    ceiling   3 x ceiling   was, single-shot
    wow-wotlk       480 s    6916 s        5.8 h          24 min
    wow-tbc        1800 s    6916 s        5.8 h           1.5 h
    wow-vanilla    1800 s    6916 s        5.8 h           1.5 h
    wow-tortoise  10800 s   21600 s         18 h             9 h

Those are the numbers this change costs, written down because the round that
introduced a management ceiling quoted only the flattering end of its own
arithmetic. The first three rows read 3702 s and 3.1 h for one day: that was
`MANAGEMENT_FLOOR_SECONDS` sitting exactly on the slowest measured boot, with
no margin, which a review refuted by refusing a 3703 s boot. The margin is
1.87x and the price of it is the difference between those two columns.
A quiet server still ends its wait after ONE window (`_read_world()`
answers `quiet` the moment two readings match), so none of this is paid by a
server that is merely down — only by one that talks for ever.

Tortoise is the row worth reading twice. Its `timeout_s` was widened to 10800
on 2026-09-05 (`eb5f3b3f`, the 7.7 gate), and at that size ANY multiple of two
or more lands on `READY_CEILING_SECONDS`, so its management ceiling and the
install's are the same six hours and cannot be separated without giving it a
single window. That is a property of the catalogue number, not of this constant:
10800 s was measured as a stage TOTAL and is read here as how long the server may
say NOTHING, and nothing has ever measured three hours of Tortoise silence.
Narrowing it belongs to whoever owns `catalog.json`'s `ready` block; recorded
here so the next reader does not have to re-derive it.

    `container_state()` first, and its `started_at` is handed to the log read:
    that is what scopes the log to the CURRENT run, without which a restarted
    server's previous run — its old ready banner included — is still sitting
    there (`docker._logs`, measured 2026-08-22). It also means the restart count
    and the text come from the same look at the machine.

    `docker._logs()` rather than a public function because there is none: that
    module's only public log reader is `follow_logs()`, which streams
    `docker logs -f` and does not return. The same reach as
    `ABANDONED_WORKER_SECONDS`' into `runner`, and for the same reason — naming
    the real thing beats copying it.

    An EMPTY `status` is how this recognises "could not ask", and that is read
    off the value rather than caught as an exception. Until 2026-09-05 the
    unknown case was an `except docker.DockerCommandError` around both calls,
    and NEITHER of them raises it: `container_state()` logs "could not read the
    state of ..." and returns a default `ContainerState()` on a non-zero
    inspect, `_logs()` logs and returns `""`, and `_docker()` turns even a
    missing CLI into a non-zero `CompletedProcess` rather than an exception (its
    docstring says so, and gives the reason). So the branch that produced
    `restarts=None` was unreachable, and every failed inspect arrived as the
    fabricated `restarts=0` that `WorldOutput`'s own docstring forbids — a crash
    loop underneath an unaskable daemon would have run out the whole ceiling.
    RED on m910q 2026-09-05: `assert 0 is None`, from a `container_state` double

    a log that does not therefore looks like a silent container, which
    `wait_for_ready()` refuses after one quiet budget. That is the conservative

      "is it still there" test that runs before this one answers for it, and a
      loop gets named a stop. `restarts` grown by `restart_loop` since the FIRST
      readable count; `None` on either side is "could not ask" and counts
      towards nothing.
    * **gone** second: a status outside `_ALIVE_STATUSES`. It is still ahead of
      the log-based questions, because an exited container is silent too and
      "it exited" is the better sentence.
    * **fatal** third: `markers.fatal` matched HERE as well as inside
      `docker.wait_ready()`, so the refusal can quote the line the server
      printed rather than the alternation from the catalog.
    * **quiet** last: this reading identical to the last. Any change at all
      counts as life, a shrinking log included — a log that shrank means the
      container restarted or `docker logs` failed, and both are better answered
      by the questions above than by declaring silence.

    "quiet" splits in two on the STATUS, and that split is a sentence rather
    than a decision: both end the wait. `WorldOutput.status` is `""` only when
    `container_state()` could not read the container at all, and two identical
    unreadable readings are `unreadable` — docker stopped answering — not
    `quiet`. Until 2026-09-05 a daemon that died mid-wait was reported as "it
    stopped printing anything at all ... so this one is stuck rather than slow",
    which contradicts the announcement printed moments earlier (this wait is
    watching the log; it had not read the log) and sends the user to
    `docker compose logs`, the one command that cannot work either. Nothing was
    learned about the server, and the refusal said it had been.

    Four questions, and the third is the one the first version of this did not

    * **gone**: a status off `_STILL_UP_STATUSES`. The container's CURRENT log is
      then the log of the run that died, so it is quoted first.
    * **restarted**: `restarts` changed at all, against the first readable count
      this watch took. `!= 0` rather than `> 0`: a count that went DOWN is a
      container that was replaced rather than restarted, and the run that
      printed the banner is just as gone either way.
    * **the banner is not in this run's log any more**. `docker.wait_ready()`
      matched `banner` in the CURRENT run's log a moment ago — that is what made
      it answer True — so a readable log without it is a different run, whatever
      the count says. This is the only question that answers the FIRST reading:
      `restart: unless-stopped` backs off for 100 ms, and between the banner and
      this watch's first look sit `_auth_ready()`'s two docker commands and the
      caller's own, so a container that aborted a second after `ready...` can be
      up again under a new run before anything here has looked once. The count
      is then already the new one and there is nothing for "grew" to grow from.
      (Cold review, 2026-09-16, with the timings.)
    * **fatal**, for the world that aborts without the container noticing yet.

    An EMPTY log is not an answer to the third question: `docker._logs()` returns
    `""` both for "this run has printed nothing" and for "the read failed"
    (`_world_output()`'s docstring has that gap), and calling a failed read a
    restarted container would refuse a healthy server on a hiccup. The same rule
    `_read_world()` follows — the unknown value is never a verdict.

    `before` is `None` on the first reading and is what makes the words honest:
    after a restart the current log is the NEW run's, so quoting it as the dying
    words would attribute the fresh boot's lines to the crash. With no earlier
    reading in hand there is nothing to quote, and the caller says so instead.

    The bool half of `StagedInstaller.wait_for_ready()`, and the reason it
    exists is that one catalogue number was being read two ways. The install
    spine spends `install.native.ready.timeout_s` as a window that restarts
    every time the world server prints; six other waits — the base
    `controller.Controller.wait_ready()`, `TortoiseController.wait_ready()` and
    the four `docker_ctl.wait_server_ready()` — built a `ReadySpec` from the
    same field and waited it out ONCE, as a fixed total wall clock. That is the
    reading the incident of 2026-09-04 disproved: TBC's world server took 46.0
    minutes to its first `Avg Diff:` against a `timeout_s` of 1800 while
    printing the whole way, and every one of those six sites would have called
    it a failure at 30 minutes exactly as the installer did.

    So the number has one meaning in this app now, and it is this one. The
    alternative was to rename the field, which needs `catalog.py` and
    `catalog.json` — not this lane's to edit — and would have left six sites
    spending a budget under a name that said they should not.

    **The call is bounded**, by `management_ceiling(ready.timeout)`: at least
    `MANAGEMENT_CEILING_WINDOWS` of the caller's windows, never shorter than
    `MANAGEMENT_FLOOR_SECONDS`, never longer than
    `READY_CEILING_SECONDS`. So `timeout=` shortens the call only down to that
    measured floor, and deliberately: the two callers on
    `docker.azerothcore_ready()`'s 480 s default were bounded at 1920 s between
    2026-09-04 and 2026-09-05, which is shorter than every 9p first boot this
    project has measured, and refusing a server that was about to succeed is the
    defect this file is here to remove rather than to relocate.

    `wait`, `output` and `monotonic` are resolved at CALL time, never bound as
    defaults: `docker.wait_ready_for` bound at import is a function a test's
    `monkeypatch` can no longer replace, and most of those sites are tested
    that way.

    `wsl_distro` reaches the WAIT and both READS. It reached only the wait until
    2026-09-05; `_world_output()`'s docstring has what that cost.

    Returns True once the world server has reported ready AND stayed up for
    `READY_GRACE_SECONDS` afterwards — `watch_after_ready()` holds why a banner
    on its own is not an answer. Returns False for that watch, for
    every one of `_read_world()`'s verdicts and at the ceiling, because a
    caller polling a running server wants a bool — the five sentences are the
    install spine's job, and it keeps its own loop to build them.

    A docker that will not answer at all needs no special case here, and one was
    written and then deleted: `WorldOutput("", None, "")` twice running is the
    `unreadable` verdict, so an unreachable daemon already ends this after one
    window — exactly what the single-shot wait it replaced did. The guard that
    checked for it explicitly survived its own mutation on m910q 2026-09-05
    (`if False:`, whole file still green) and differed from having no guard in
    only one case: a daemon that was unreachable for the first look and
    answered for the second, where it gave up on a container it could by then
    see. A branch whose only distinct behaviour is the wrong one.

    `cancel` (T247 review) ends the WAIT and nothing else: False, with
    `MANAGEMENT_WAIT_STOPPED` logged. The world is left loading -- T158, never
    stopped mid-load -- because a Start or Restart that waits has nothing to put
    back. No press of the app's reaches this with a Stop today: Start and
    Restart on the Server tab return once the containers are started and wait
    for nothing (`controller_view.start_server()`, `_do_restart()`).

        Extracted from `run()` on 2026-09-08 so the rebuild reports through it
        rather than beside it. That is not tidiness: `^--- <name>` is what gate
        scripts, log captures and the interrupted-import watchers match on, and
        a second loop printing its own nearly-identical marker is a second place
        for that format to drift. One run WAS missed on 2026-09-03 by a watcher
        that could not see the stage it was armed for.

        The percentage is of STAGES BEHIND YOU, not of work done: the twelve are
        wildly unequal -- `conf` is seconds and `build` is an hour -- so this
        says "9 of 12 started", which is true, rather than implying three
        quarters of the time is gone, which it is not. A resumed install counts
        the same way, because the stages it skips are done. A rebuild's three
        count the same way again, and the denominator is ITS length: "Step 1 of
        3" over a rebuild is honest, where "Step 4 of 9" would describe an
        install that is not happening.

        `ctx.state` threads through the loop and is RETURNED, because
        `_run_one()` writes the state file and the caller needs what was written
        -- `run()` clears the error record against it and advertises the realm
        with it.

        **The failure record is written HERE, and that is not a tidy-up.** It
        used to be a `try` in `run()` around this loop, reading the `state`
        variable the loop assigned on each pass. Moving the loop into a function
        moved that variable with it, and the caller's copy stayed at the state
        the run STARTED with -- so a stage-three failure wrote a state file
        whose `completed` was empty, throwing away the record of the two stages
        that had finished and turning the next press into a re-clone. Caught by
        `test_a_moved_upstream_refuses_by_file_and_line_before_anything_is_built`

        A rebuild is a different act with a different failure surface, and three
        of the install's stages would be actively wrong to re-enter here:
        `clone-*` fetches, `generate-compose` rewrites files a running server is
        using, and `import` reaches for a database that has a player's
        characters in it. None of the three has anything to do with "the
        worldserver does not contain the module I just installed".

        **`write-dockerfile` IS re-entered, and until 2026-09-09 it was not.**
        The exclusion above was written about files a running server reads, and
        the Dockerfile is not one: nothing but `docker build` ever opens it, and
        the stage is idempotent by text (`dockerfile.write()` leaves matching
        bytes alone, so the mtime does not move and the layer cache survives)
        and refuses a file this app did not write rather than replacing it. What

        (`.notes/gates/tortoise-upgrade-m910q-2026-09-09/`): that install's
        Dockerfile had been rendered 2026-09-07 and the template was fixed
        2026-09-08 (`3a1ed6ee` -- both `FROM` lines to ubuntu:24.04 and the
        `INSERT IGNORE` rewrite one migration needs to apply at all), so the
        Rebuild button would have compiled the 22.04 recipe again and produced
        exactly the image the upgrade existed to replace. The upgrade only
        worked because the hand ran this stage first. A fix shipped in a
        template reaches an existing install through this line or through
        nothing.

        Selected by PRESENCE, not prepended: `dockerfile_dir` is None for
        AzerothCore because that checkout ships its own Dockerfile, so its
        family has no such stage and `stage_named()` would refuse every WotLK
        rebuild by name. `rebuild_confirmation()` reads the same fact off the
        entry, and `test_the_confirmation_promises_the_re_render_for_exactly_the_games_that_get_it`
        binds the two derivations across every shipped entry.

        `recreate` is this tuple's own stage rather than the install's `up`,
        and `docker.staged_up_argv()` holds the argument: `up -d` was measured
        to replace a container whose CONFIGURATION changed, and a rebuild
        changes neither the compose files nor the image tag. Never recorded --
        `up` is not either, and a rebuild must not be able to leave a state file
        claiming a stage the install's own resume would then skip. The re-render
        keeps the family's own `recorded=True` for the opposite reason: it is
        the install's stage, run with the install's body, and it really did
        happen.

        the four that are NOT here. `up` is the one that matters: this press is
        for a server somebody stopped in order to run it, and ending by starting
        the world would put back the very thing the press refuses to run
        alongside. `build`, `generate-compose` and `write-dockerfile` have
        nothing to do with three SQL files.

        `import` is exactly `_import`, which on an install the probe reads as
        finished runs the marker rule's own table, applies the phases the plan
        declares `rerun_on_marked` and returns (T11). This tuple does not
        re-implement that route; it is the second way in to it, the first being
        `engine.run()` through the CLI harness.

        **Recorded off**, and it is the family's own stage with the record
        taken away rather than a copy of the body. The install's `import` is
        recorded and rightly — it imported. This press reaches the same body and
        the body does not import, so a record written here would claim a stage
        that did not happen, and an install whose state file has no `import` in
        it (one made by the shell scripts, or one killed mid-install) would have
        its next resume skip the import on the strength of this press. The same
        rule `rebuild_stages()` applies to `recreate`, arrived at from the other

        **`cancel_note` swapped, not cleared**, and for the same reason
        `recorded` is turned off: the install's `import` carries
        `IMPORT_CANCEL_NOTE` because its `partial` arm calls `gate.reset()`
        before it re-imports, and that promise is false on this route —
        `_only_the_rerunnable_phases` never calls `stage_import()`, so
        `gate.reset()` is unreachable (T19, finding 2). An empty string looked
        like the fix and was rejected round 1: the spine still says a stage's
        note once, up front, and a Stop can still land mid-run inside
        `sqlplan.apply()`'s own between-run check — silence there is not the
        same as a true sentence, it is just no advance warning at all.
        `RERUN_CANCEL_NOTE` is the true one, and `_rerun_on_marked()` passes it

        and nothing asked about the world. The second reading is T7's finding
        from the applier's side: `start_database()` waits for the container to

        got past: the banner is taken each time the DATABASE comes up and
        dropped when it goes down, the Server tab's Stop takes the database
        down with the world, and a crash-looping world -- the Tortoise install
        whose honor maintenance truncates a missing table, the case T159 is
        about -- always reads as running (`docker.world_running()` counts
        `restarting` as up, and each cycle spends its first seconds `running`).
        So the stop is this press's own first step, and the dialog the person
        said Yes to says so.

        **Only an explicit running is stopped.** `None` is still the refusal it
        always was: a stop sent on "could not ask" is a guess about Docker.

        **The offer is read again BEFORE the stop**, and a press whose dialog no
        longer describes these databases is refused with the world left up. The
        family reads the record again anyway and refuses the same press; this
        reading exists so that the one thing such a press did is not stopping a
        server somebody is playing on. It is taken only on this branch, where
        the world is up and so is the database.

        **The stop is T158's**: `stop_containers(known=(spec,))` waits for a
        CMaNGOS world that is still loading -- it cannot hear SIGTERM until it
        has, and would be SIGKILLed mid-load at the end of the grace -- and
        stops at once a world that is not running (`restarting` is not), which
        is where a crash-looping one spends each backoff. The wait's sentences
        reach the panel as it waits (`_speaking`); the press's Cancel gives the
        stop up with nothing sent (`abandon`), and "Stop now anyway" forces it
        (`_stop_control(rollback=False)`, the rebuild's own reading of a Cancel
        before anything is touched). The by-name stop has a process deadline
        (`docker.STOP_PROCESS_DEADLINE_SECONDS`); past it the outcome is not
        known, and the refusal says the world may still be running.

        The world is not read again here after the stop: the import stage's own
        guard (`_guard_then`) is that reading, right before the first write, and

          skipped silently: a press that reported success having written
          nothing would teach the user that the button is decorative.
        * **anything but `populated`** — `absent`, `partial` and `unreadable`
          are databases with nobody's data in them, or none this app could
          read. Adopting is a claim about an import somebody already made; over
          these it would be a claim about nothing.
        * **a gap** — `populated` says a `player_data` table has rows in it, and
          it short-circuits on the first one. It does NOT say the plan's other
          schemas exist or that its other tables are there, and this press
          writes a row saying the whole plan finished. So the gate is asked once
          more, for presence only (`MarkerGate.adoption_gaps()`), and a gap is a
          refusal naming it.

        **Presence and never completeness**, and that is the ticket's own
        conclusion rather than a shortcut. Three rounds tried to derive "this
        dump finished" from the plan and each found the next layer of inference

        these checks are only the floor under it — they keep the row off a
        database that is plainly not the thing being claimed.

        **The probe runs again after the write**, and it is the only proof this
        press has that anything happened: the writer answers by not raising,
        which is the client's exit status and not a reading of the row. A
        re-probe that does not say `imported` is a write that did not land where

        leaves the tags or the servers half-way; reading the Stop would end the
        restore's wait on its first ask, so `saying` tells the player Stop waits.

        compose can recreate two services and fail the third, or recreate all three and
        then fail the running-container check. `before_replace` is the boundary the
        wrapper in `rebuild()` needs: it is called synchronously, after every argument is
        prepared and immediately before the compose command is issued, so a failure
        anywhere in front of it -- the readiness probe, the progress yield the caller is
        suspended at, `container_spec()` -- is still "nothing was touched", and only a
        failure from the command itself is not. (Round 2 read the first yield as that
        boundary; the round-2 review pointed out the daemon can go away between the
        probe and the call, and a consumer can stop at the yield, so the flag moved to

        `press` is the "Server build ▾" entry that started this, named where a sentence
        says what pressing it again does (T223); the update route passes its own.

        `landed` is the update route's record of where its sources landed (`source_revs`,
        T589 cold review): called once the press has succeeded and the build record is
        written, BEFORE `after_ready()`, which may start the movement-map job that stamps
        its generation from both. Must not raise.

        `servers_down` is the update route's (T179): what the family does between
        the recreate's stop and its start, and again in a rollback's window before
        the old build starts (`ServersDownWork`). A Rebuild press passes none.

        The action `apply.ApplyReport.rebuild_required` has named since it was
        written -- "worldserver REBUILD required before this takes effect",
        printed by the Modules tab after 20 of the 41 shipped manifests -- and
        which nothing in `yulon/ui/` offered until 2026-09-08.

        **Why re-pressing Install was never it.** `stage_build()` skips the
        compile when the state file records a build and the daemon holds every
        image, and `composegen.image_tag()` is derived from the FOLDER, so
        adding a module changes no tag and the images all still exist. Measured
        through this app's own predicates on yulon-ubuntu: `state.has("build")`
        True, `built_images()` True, `build_would_be_skipped()` True. A user who
        pressed Install again got a few seconds of output and no change, which
        is very probably what "i used the this thing to rebuild the server but
        nothing changes when i log back in" (2026-09-07) is a report of.

        **What it deliberately does not do: SQL.** One press does the compile
        and the restart, and touches no database. Three reasons, in the order
        they decided it:

        1. a database write behind a confirmation whose entire subject is a
           compile is a write nobody agreed to, and it would leave no way to ask
           for the compile alone -- which is what somebody re-testing a build
           wants;
        2. the databases here hold a player's characters. Every other path in
           this app that writes to them (`repair_import`, `restore`) is a
           separate, separately-confirmed action, and one of them arms on two
           presses;
        3. the reported reason it would be unnecessary is CARRIED, not
           verified here: AzerothCore applies a module's SQL through its own
           updater for the modules in `AC_MODULES_LIST`, which CMake bakes in
           at configure time, so a module compiled in by this rebuild is in
           that list from this build onward. Nothing in this repository
           measures that, and nothing in this function depends on it -- the
           closing line tells the user to look rather than promising it
           happened.

        **Every transient name this makes, and every way out (T79).** Two names
        per image in `built_image_refs()` -- four images on an AzerothCore
        install, so up to eight names: `<ref>-rollback` before the compile
        (`_keep_rollback`), and `<ref>-failed` only if a restore starts
        (`_restore_rollback`). A `-rollback` name must not outlive the press:

        * **the rebuild finished** -- the `-rollback` names are released here,
          and no `-failed` name was ever made;
        * **`_keep_rollback` refuses** -- the names it had already made are
          released before it raises;
        * **a stage failed before the compile finished** -- released; the live
          tags never moved, so they were duplicates;
        * **...the compile was stopped or abandoned, or a stopped build's record is
          there (scoped re-review)** -- KEPT, here and in every restore, with
          `STOPPED_BUILD_FILE` (T225, measured live: BuildKit moved the live tag 13
          minutes after a Stop): every Start compares the tags with them, and the
          next Rebuild, Update or Return settles them (`_settle_stopped_build()`)
          and the record goes only once that press succeeds;
        * **the world came up and then stopped** (`WorldStoppedAfterReadyError`,
          T71's keep) -- released, and the new build keeps the live names;
        * **a stage failed after the compile** -- `_restore_rollback` puts the
          old build back and releases both sets, its `-failed` names after the
          recreate that frees them (see `FAILED_TAG_SUFFIX`);
        * **...and the old build did not come up either** -- released too, which
          is the exit that kept them until T79;
        * **...and docker refused to NAME or to MOVE a tag** -- the `-rollback`
          names are KEPT, deliberately: the restore did not happen, so they are
          the only copy of the old build there is, and the sentence the user
          reads says exactly that. That exit, and a stop of the new build's
          servers that failed, raise `RollbackNotDone` (T197), so the update
          route leaves its sources with the build the tags still name;
        * **anything that is not an `InstallerError`** -- released if no compile
          finished, kept and logged if one did.

        A release is `_let_go()`, which reads the daemon's refusal and asks again
        with `-f` where the only thing in the way is a stopped container -- the
        leak the round-3 gate found, and the reason the table above was written
        down rather than assumed.

        **With the images gone there is no rollback to keep (T170).** Names
        gone is not always that: when this install's containers still hold a
        whole build by image id, `_keep_rollback()` keeps THAT, and the press
        is an ordinary one (round 2). With no such build it is refused by
        default, as owner answer 2 has it. `missing_images_ok` is the
        "Rebuild the server…" press's own answer, given because its
        confirmation says, before the player agrees, that a server whose images
        are gone is compiled without one (`installer.rebuild_confirmation()`;
        the owner's decision of 2026-09-28). Then `_keep_rollback()` keeps
        nothing and says so, and every failure says what it leaves: a compile
        that fails or is stopped leaves the containers as they were and the
        images still missing, and a new build that does not come up stays on
        the containers with nothing to put back. "Update the server to
        latest…" does not pass it, so it still refuses there -- its
        confirmation promises the build you have keeps running.

        Raises:
            InstallerError: any refusal (see `_refuse_unless_rebuildable`), any
                stage that failed, or a cancel. The message is the sentence a

        a test rather than reasoned about.** AzerothCore's core source has
        `dest: "."` -- the server directory IS the checkout -- and that
        repository tracks its own `docker-compose.yml`, which
        `stage_generate_compose()` then overwrites with this app's marked one
        (its docstring calls that "the one recognised exception"). So every
        healthy WotLK install has a modified tracked file in its checkout, and
        the first version of this route did both wrong things with it at once:
        `local_edits()` reported it, so the update was refused on every WotLK
        install there has ever been; and with the guard silenced the reset put
        upstream's compose back, after which `rebuild()`'s own guard refused
        with "these compose files were not written by Yu'lon" and the press
        ended having broken the install it was updating.

        CMaNGOS adds the paths its carried patches edit. Its sources all live
        under `src/`, so it never meets the compose case, and the two
        contributions have never overlapped -- which is why this is a mapping
        per `dest` rather than one list.

        update server to latest, with a warning and recommendation to take a

        (`ui/controller_view.py`) and the copy is `installer.update_to_latest_
        confirmation()`'s; what is here is the move, its refusals, and putting
        everything back when the thing it was moved for does not work.

        `to_pin` aims the same route at `EmulatorSource.rev` instead of at
        upstream's tip -- the way BACK, and the design's reason for it being the
        same route rather than a second one is that every refusal, every restore
        and every record above is the same sentence in both directions. A
        separate "return" path would be a second set of guards to keep in step
        with these, and the one it would be easiest to forget is the one that
        matters most: a return that did not check for local commits would
        discard work somebody did on top of an untested build.

        **The order is the whole design, and each step is where it is because of
        what is still free at that point.**

        1. `_refuse_unless_rebuildable()` first, because a folder this app does
           not own, or one with no install record, is a folder nothing here may
           fetch into. It is the rebuild's own guard, reused: this press ENDS in
           a rebuild, so a press that would be refused there must be refused
           before it moves anything rather than after.
        2. The three source refusals (`_refuse_unless_updatable()`), all of them
           for every source, BEFORE the first fetch. A route that moved source
           one and then refused source two would leave a tree half a version
           ahead of the image, which is the state this whole method is arranged
           to prevent.
        3. The moves, one source at a time, each remembered as it happens, then
           what this app owns written back over what they brought (T630: a
           family's check may start the database, which needs Yu'lon's compose),
           then the family's reading of what they brought (`check_moved_sources()`,
           T179), which can refuse.
        4. The carried patches: resolved dry (which can refuse), then written;
           then the family's background work stopped (`before_rebuild()`).
        5. `rebuild()`, unchanged and in full, rollback tags included. This is
           deliberately NOT a copy of the rebuild with sources bolted on: the
           image rollback, the recipe restore and the "nothing was touched"
           promise are that method's, they are hard-won, and a second
           implementation of them would be a second one to keep correct. What
           the family does with the servers down rides into it
           (`servers_down_work()`, T179: TrinityCore's changed world tables,
           before the new build starts); its rollback half puts the sources back
           first, so the old build's tables come from the old checkout.
        6. The family's after-work on the running build (`after_update()`, T179:
           what was left as it was, the map data's sentence), before the closing
           line.

        Every failure from step 3 through step 5 puts every moved source back on
        the commit it came from, so what is on disk and what the running image was
        compiled from agree (a step-6 failure leaves them: they already agree).
        The step-5 exceptions are a build the rebuild KEPT
        (`WorldStoppedAfterReadyError`, T71) and a rollback that stopped before the
        old build was back on its tags (`RollbackNotDone`, T197): either way the
        new build is what the tags name, so its sources stay with it and are
        recorded, for the same invariant (`SOURCES_KEPT_NOTE`, T179; `SOURCES_LEFT_NOTE`).
        A rollback that left the tags MIXED has no new build to keep them with: they
        go back, nothing is recorded, and the sentence says a Rebuild is owed
        (`SOURCES_MIXED_NOTE`, fix round 1).
        That is the one invariant a user cannot check for themselves and the one
        that quietly breaks everything afterwards: a Modules tab reading a source
        tree that is a hundred commits ahead of the binary answering on the port
        is a tab telling the truth about the wrong thing.

        Raises:
            InstallerError: any refusal, any stage that failed, or a cancel. The
                message is the sentence a user reads, and when sources had
                already moved it says that they were put back.

        """The three source refusals, for every source, before anything is fetched.

        Each is the prior art's own gate, read out of `dml wow update`
        (`cli/dml` 11163-11250) and `wow-manage.sh`'s `update_server_source`
        (7319-7460) on 2026-09-16, and each is FAIL-CLOSED where those two were
        not:

        * **origin.** Both prior launchers refuse a checkout whose `origin` is
          not the fork the server needs -- wow-manage by asking "pull from this
          remote anyway?", `dml` by making it a hard error with no override,
          because "pulling upstream AzerothCore here would break the playerbots
          integration". `dml`'s reading is taken. The question wow-manage asks
          is one nobody has the information to answer at the moment it is asked.
        * **a dirty tree.** Both prior launchers keep going: they stash the
          edits, pull, and pop them back on top, and wow-manage's own comment
          admits what happens when that conflicts ("the updated file wins").
          This refuses instead, and the reason is that a stash is a promise this
          app cannot keep -- `_update()` is `reset --hard`, not `pull --ff-only`,
          and the pop lands on a tree that may share no history with the one the
          edit was made against. A refusal that names the files is a worse
          evening and a better outcome than a silent three-way merge into
          somebody's server source. `app_written_paths()` is subtracted first;
          see `git.RunnerGit.local_edits()`.
        * **local commits.** NEITHER prior launcher checks. `git pull --ff-only`
          would have refused a diverged branch, which is a third of the case;
          this route resets, which would discard the commits outright and leave
          them reachable only through the reflog. `git.HistoryReader`'s own
          docstring is the argument: a checkout somebody committed their work
          into is perfectly clean by `status`. **This one depends on
          `git._only_grafts()` to stay usable at all** (T82, measured live
          2026-09-16): a `depth: 1` source that has been updated and then
          returned to its pin carries two grafted, unconnected commits in
          `.git/shallow`, counts as one commit ahead of upstream, and without
          that second layer both buttons refuse it for ever.

        `None` from any of the three reads refuses, and the sentence says which
        of the two it is. "We could not ask" is never "there is nothing to
        lose" -- the rule every `None` in `git.py` is documented under.

        **The closing clause changes half way down the list, and the change is
        the point.** The refusals above `no_local_commits` end "nothing was
        fetched and nothing was changed", and that is literally true. The ones
        below it end "nothing in that folder was changed", because
        `no_local_commits()` FETCHES -- its own docstring says so, and names the
        network round trip it pays -- so by then objects and `FETCH_HEAD` have
        been written into `.git`. Nothing in the working tree has moved, which
        is what the user is being told and what they can check; saying "nothing
        was fetched" there would be a sentence this method knows to be false
        (cold review round 2, 2026-09-16).

        Returns `(source, dest, sha)` per source, with the sha read HERE rather
        than inside the loop that moves them: the restore path needs a commit
        that was read before anything fetched, and a read taken after the first
        source has already moved is a read of a tree this press has changed.

        on m910q, 2026-09-02). The caller's `state` was read BEFORE that, so

        once and threw the refusal away. `docker.remove_image()` is deliberately
        soft -- it logs and returns the daemon's words -- so a name docker
        declined to remove was left on the daemon with nothing said anywhere a
        user or a gate would look. The round-3 gate then found a stale
        `ac-wotlk-db-import:...-rollback` after two clean rebuilds, and the
        earlier failed build had left a `client-data` one the same way.

        It is not luck which two: the rebuild's recreate is `compose up
        --force-recreate --no-deps` over `spec.compose_services()`, which never
        selects the one-shot import or the client-data job, so their EXITED
        containers still reference the pre-rebuild images when these names are
        let go. `-rollback` is by then the image's only name, so removing it
        removes the image, and the daemon refuses: `conflict: unable to delete
        <id> (must be forced) - container <id> is using its referenced image`.
        Every rebuild of this shape leaks two names, which is what "a leftover,
        not a rollback" in the gate actually was.

        So the refusal is READ. `must be forced` is the daemon saying the only
        thing in the way is a container that is not running, and the second ask
        carries `-f`, which takes the NAME off and leaves the layers the exited
        container holds. Anything else -- `cannot be forced`, a read-only layer
        store, a daemon that went away -- is returned to the caller to say out
        loud, because a name this module documents as transient sitting on the

        the compile is about to overwrite, and this keeps the two files the
        re-render is about to overwrite. Both are taken before anything runs and
        both exist so that a press stopped early leaves the machine as it was.

        Bytes, not text: what has to go back is what was there, and a read/write
        round trip through `str` would rewrite a file's line endings on Windows
        and call it a restore.

        **THREE answers, and it had two.** Until round 2 of T8's review every
        `OSError` became `None`, and `None` means "there was no file, so remove
        the one the re-render made". Traced by the cold reviewer: a `Dockerfile`
        this process cannot READ (a permission, a directory in its place)
        answered `None`, `write-dockerfile` then refused it as `UNREADABLE`
        saying "Nothing was touched", and the restore deleted the user's file
        and reported "put back exactly as it was". On Windows the `unlink`
        raised `PermissionError` instead -- not an `InstallerError`, so it flew
        past `_let_go` and left the rollback tags on the daemon. "Could not ask"
        is not "was not there", which is the same rule `_keep_rollback` applies
        to `images_built()` returning `None` one method above.

        The import is local because `families/dockerfile.py` imports `Secrets`
        from this module; `installer.py` breaks the same cycle the same way. The
        names are taken from it rather than restated here, so a rename is one

        created by this app" -- a sentence that was false, this app having
        written every byte, and whose only remedy was deleting a part-finished
        multi-gigabyte clone by hand. Driven, not reasoned: the TBC-on-Windows
        gate was killed mid-clone on `yulon-win11` (2026-09-03) and refused its
        own 162 MB checkout on the next attempt.

        **And that one failure is the one this still does not fix.** Measured
        on m910q 2026-09-05: `_clone_core()` clones into the SERVER DIR, and
        both seams in `git.py` (`RunnerGit.clone`, `ContainerGit.clone`) begin
        by emptying a destination that has no `.git` -- so the record written
        below is removed at the start of stage one on every fresh install, kill
        or no kill. Three tests in `test_families_azerothcore.py` asserted
        otherwise and passed only because their clone doubles skipped that
        line; with the doubles made faithful (`as_the_clone_seam_does()`) all
        three went red, and they now say what happens. What this method DOES
        buy is every stage after the first: their destinations are under
        `modules/`, the record survives them, and the retry resumes. Closing
        the rest means changing where `clone-core` clones -- `git clone <url>
        <dir>` refuses a directory that is not empty, which is why the seam
        empties it -- and that is a `git.py` change with a live gate behind it,
        not a patch here.

        **`5eef8d9f` recorded it on the `except InstallerError` path instead,
        and an adversarial review the same day was right that this misses the
        failure that produced it.** SIGKILL, a power cut and an unhandled
        exception never reach an `except` block, so the harshest endings -- the
        ones a person actually meets -- still left an unclaimed folder. A claim
        that only survives a cooperative failure is a claim about the easy case.

        **Why the early write is safe, which is what §38 thought was the
        obstacle.** The bug list recorded that three tests forbid writing before
        stage one, two of them because an install into the USER'S OWN git
        checkout must leave that checkout untouched, and concluded that the
        "whose checkout is this" question had to be moved ahead of the claim
        first. Re-read on 2026-09-03: it is already ahead. `_guard()` refuses
        every non-empty folder outright, with ONE deliberate exception -- a
        directory holding `.git`, deferred so the clone stage can say whose fork
        it is instead of "this folder is not empty". So the only folder that
        reaches stage one non-empty and unclaimed is somebody's checkout, and
        `started_empty` is exactly the predicate that excludes it. All three
        tests drive a `.git` directory; none of them constrains an empty folder.

        `started_empty` is also no longer a fact carried across the whole
        install to be used at the end. It is read and acted on in consecutive
        statements, which is as narrow as the window gets without a lock: the
        review's point that a second install, a dropped-in file or a remount
        could invalidate it stands, and is now a race of microseconds rather
        than of hours.

        **A failure to claim is a refusal, not a shrug.** The late version had
        to be silent -- it ran with an `InstallerError` already in flight, so
        anything it raised replaced the sentence the user was about to read.
        Nothing is in flight here. A folder this app cannot write a 200-byte
        JSON file into is a folder the install cannot succeed in, and saying so
        now costs one attempt instead of one clone.

        Nothing is written when the folder is not ours to fill, and nothing when
        a record already exists: a resume must not overwrite the progress it is

        by removing a destination with no `.git`, so the folder the claim was
        locked on is gone by the second stage and the clone's is a new one. A
        stage that finds the folder already locked costs one read. The first
        secret -- CMaNGOS's `.db_password` in `db-password`, `.env` in
        `generate-compose` -- is written inside a stage, and so after its lock.

        Install only. A rebuild, an update or an adoption goes through
        `_staged()` without this: changing an existing folder's permissions is
        Repair server files…'s offer (`serverlock.route_for_app()`). Off Windows
        the wrapper asks nothing. A lock that fails says so once and the stages
        run as they did before T174; a later stage asks again only if it finds
        a different folder there, as after WotLK's clone
        (`serverlock.InstallLock`).

        A resume locks the folder it resumes in, and so does a resume of an
        install begun before T174: the folder holds its record, so its first
        stage this time locks what is already there, the secrets an earlier run
        wrote included (`serverlock.py`: the lock is carried onto what inherits).
        A folder that grants a SPECIFIC account or group is left as it is and
        said so (`serverlock.InstallLock`); Repair server files… offers it.

        Only a folder that is ours: one the install `started_empty` in, or one
        holding this install's record. The one other folder a stage meets is
        somebody's own git checkout, which `_guard()` lets through so the clone
        stage can say whose it is -- and refuses there, leaving it untouched
        (`_claim_before_writing()`'s rule), so its permissions are left alone

        done: preflight judged the disk before anything asked what the press

        without a stage context: the record AND the daemon's images, because a
        record alone is a hint (`InstallState.has()`), and a recorded build
        whose images were pruned compiles again and needs the whole floor.

        The daemon is asked only when the record already says `build`, so a

        Container names are global per engine and every AzerothCore install in
        the wild uses the same three, so this is not exotic: a second install
        while the first exists is the normal way to meet it. The remedy named
        is Remove, which the app has.

        **Existence is asked FIRST, and that is the whole of the fresh-install
        case.** `container_project()` answers `UNREADABLE` for any non-zero
        `docker inspect`, and `docker inspect <missing>` exits 1 — so asking it
        about a container that is not there refused every install on every
        machine that had never run this server, naming a container the user
        could then not find (review, 2026-08-23). The pre-existing caller in
        `docker._running()` guards the same way, `if name not in running:
        continue`; this is that check, spelled for containers that exist but are
        stopped as well as running ones.

        **The sentence names the folder, not only the project id.** T32: a
        reporter told a container belonged to `yulon-wow-wotlk-db937032` has no
        way to act on that — the id names nothing they can see in their own
        file manager. `container_working_dir()` reads the working-dir sibling
        of the same compose label, so the refusal can say WHERE to go instead
        of a hash; `None` or `UNREADABLE` from that seam means the label could
        not be read, and the sentence says so rather than printing either
        value. A project this app made (`composegen.PROJECT_PREFIX`) gets the
        friendlier wording, because "another install this app made" is true of
        it and is not true of a stranger's Docker Compose project, whose only
        honest remedy is to go and stop it from its own tooling.

        **The folder is where compose brought the project up FROM, not
        necessarily where it lives now.** `container_working_dir()`'s own
        docstring says the label is baked in at container creation, so a
        moved install reports its old path. The sentence says "brought up
        from … when it was created" rather than "is at", and does not offer
        "install into that folder instead" — the folder named may no longer
        be the right one to open, though the install's own tab still knows
        wherever it is now (review, Codex, 2026-09-11).

        Answered by `read_claim()`, which is the same function `_guard()` asks,
        because the previous two answers to this question disagreed. This one
        used to be `(ctx.server_dir / STATE_FILE).is_file()` — PRESENCE — on the
        premise that `_guard()` had already proved that any state file still
        here belongs to this install. The premise held only for a file
        `_guard()` could parse: every check there is written `if existing is not
        None and …`, and `read_state()` answered `None` for a file it could not
        read. So a corrupt state file passed `_guard()` as "fresh folder" and
        passed this as "ours", and `refuse_unowned_checkout()` stood down over a
        user's own checkout. `read_claim()`'s docstring has the repro.

        Three answers, and only `OWNED` is ownership. `UNKNOWN` is a state file
        that is there and unreadable, and it must never be worth more than
        `UNCLAIMED`, which is no file at all: it is the input the engine knows
        least about. `_guard()` refuses `UNKNOWN` before a stage runs, so
        reaching it here means the file was damaged or replaced DURING the
        install — which is exactly why this re-reads the folder rather than
        trusting a decision taken minutes ago.

        `ctx.state` cannot answer it either: `_guard()` hands every run a state
        object whether or not a file was read, so a fresh install and a resumed
        one are indistinguishable from the object alone. What `ctx.state` is
        good for is the identity `_guard()` already validated, which is what the
        re-read is checked against here.

        The one path in this engine that could still destroy a user's work, and
        it was reached by a first press rather than a resume. `_guard()`
        deliberately exempts a directory that is a git checkout from the
        not-empty refusal, so that a clone stage can say whose repository it is
        instead of "this folder is not empty" — but the clone stages only ever
        refused a checkout of a DIFFERENT repository. Point a first install at
        your own checkout of the same repo and every guard passed: no record, so
        `already_cloned()` is False, so the seam's update path ran, which is
        `git fetch` + `git reset --hard FETCH_HEAD`. Driven end to end (review,
        2026-08-31): `// my patch` became `// upstream`.

        Ownership is `claimed_this_folder()`, and only `Ownership.OWNED` is it.
        INSIDE a folder this install owns, an unrecorded checkout is this
        install's own unfinished work and fetch+reset is the right repair — that
        is how a `modules/` clone that died half way is healed. Outside one, it
        is somebody's repository and this app did not put it there, so it is
        named and left alone. `UNKNOWN` — a state file that is there and will
        not parse — is not ownership and gets its own sentence, because "there
        is no record here" would be a lie about a folder that has one.

        **`remote is None` is handled HERE, not at three call sites.** It used
        to `return` — safe only because
        `if has_git and existing is None: raise` was copy-pasted into
        `families/azerothcore.py` twice and `stage_clone_sources()` once, so
        the one method whose job is this could not do it alone (review,
        2026-08-31). Every one of those copies had the same `dest` this method
        is handed. `None` there does NOT mean "no checkout": it also means no
        docker CLI, a daemon that would not answer, a failed image pull, and —
        until `5c6c655c` — an SELinux denial on every enforcing box. A `.git`

        The two halves are the whole rule, and neither is sufficient alone.

        `InstallState.has()` is documented as "never a reason to skip on its
        own" because a state file can lie — a fresh empty folder once
        skip-compiled against another install's images — so the record is only
        ever a hint, and `remote` (what `git remote get-url origin` says at the
        destination, already checked against the source's URL by the caller) is
        the disk evidence that can contradict it.

        The other direction is what this method was missing until 7.1, and it
        cost the live Ubuntu gate (2026-08-30) its source tree: a clone that is
        recorded AND present was being handed to the seam anyway, where an
        existing `.git` means `git fetch` + `git reset --hard FETCH_HEAD`. That
        is destructive twice over. It discards any edit a user made to the
        server source, unrecoverably and with no warning; and it moves the
        checkout to whatever upstream has published since — so a user who stops
        a compile and starts it again does not resume the build they
        interrupted, they start a different one. A resume must not be able to
        change what is being built.

        `remote is None` with a record is the repair case and still clones: the
        checkout was deleted, or was never a checkout. A checkout with NO record
        is the other repair case — a run interrupted part-way through a clone —
        and fetch+reset is exactly right there, because a half-materialised
        working tree is not something to build against.

        Only `docker-compose.yml`. The override and the build file are left to the
        routes that already own them, and `.env` holds the password.

        `resolve_secrets()` is asked for the password because `render()` requires
        one. For a CMaNGOS entry the plan is `generated`, so the value reaches only
        the plan's `dotenv` -- never the base text, which spells
        `${DB_ROOT_PASSWORD:?…}` -- and this method never writes the dotenv. Even
        the value it mints when the password file is gone is therefore harmless here.

        **The SELinux label comes from the file, not from the host** (review,
        2026-09-24). The install decided `:z` once, from the host as it was then,
        and wrote it on every host bind. Asking the host again at press time --
        while `getenforce` fails, or with the host briefly permissive -- answers "no
        label", which read an enforcing install as stale and let a repair strip the
        label its containers need. So the label is `composegen.bind_label_of()` of
        the file on disk, and the host is asked only when there is no Yu'lon file to
        read one from. A file whose binds disagree is refused (`mixed`).

        **A conf rides with its bind** (T169). On `stale`, the confs whose folder
        setting the fresh render binds and the file on disk does not are read
        exactly (`_conf_edits()`), and the setting each still leaves at upstream's
        `""` is what the same repair sets; a conf that cannot be read is `error`.

        Returns the check, the fresh render (None when it could not be made), the
        text on disk (None when there is none) -- the snapshot a repair backs up
        and must find unchanged before it writes -- and the conf edits.

        A setting is set only where all three hold: the conf is in the server

        The press behind "Repair server files…". The owner's decision (2026-09-24):
        the player chooses when, the file is backed up first, and nothing else is
        touched -- not the override, not the build file, not `.env`, not a
        container. The running containers keep the file they were created from
        until they are recreated, which the Server tab then offers. The one
        addition (T165) is a folder the new file binds and the folder lacks,
        made empty first by `_make_server_folders()` so Docker does not make it
        as root; one that is there is left as it is. The other (T169) is the one
        conf line that makes the server write into such a folder, where the conf
        still leaves it at upstream's `""` (`_conf_edits()`): backed up and
        written the same way, after the compose file's own backup is taken and
        checked (so a backup that fails has truly written nothing) and BEFORE the
        compose file is replaced, so a press stopped between the two leaves a
        compose file still `stale` and the next press finishes -- the other way
        round, a file already binding the folder would read `current` and the
        conf it needs would never be offered again. A refusal after a conf was
        set names it and its backup, and says to press Repair again first.

        Asked again here rather than trusting the tab's earlier reading, because the
        folder can change between the two. Writes only on `stale` and, since T170,
        `upstream` -- the repository's own file a failed Update left in a WotLK
        folder, replaced by the install's own rule and backed up the same way:
        `current` writes nothing and says so with `backup=None`; every other state
        refuses.

        The write: a stamped `.repair.bak` copy first (`copy2`, so it keeps the old
        mode and mtime), checked to hold exactly the text that was validated; then
        `_replace_if_unchanged()` -- a unique fsynced temp file with the target's
        mode, `os.replace`d onto the target only if the target still says what was
        checked (Codex, 2026-09-24: the check-to-write race). Atomic on POSIX and
        Windows, so a full disk leaves the old file whole and the backup beside it.

        Raises:
            InstallerError: the check's refusal, a render or read that failed, or a
                backup or write that failed. Each says that nothing was written, or

        Not an optimisation and not tidiness — without it the install cannot
        finish. `stage_import()` probes first, and the real probe is a `docker
        exec <db container> mysql …`; with no such container it raises and the
        probe answers `unreadable`, which `stage_import()` turns into a hard
        refusal. So the fresh install died at the import stage AFTER the

        Five answers, four different things to do — `docker.DatabaseImport` is a
        five-member `Literal`, and `populated` splits on `complete`, joining
        `imported` on one side and `unreadable` on the other. That is why this
        count and the "five-branch table" below are different numbers. This
        opened "Four answers" until 2026-09-02, which read as a contradiction of
        its own closing paragraph and of `cmangos._import`. The branch table is
        `docker.repair_import()`'s, because an installer and a repair ask the
        same question of the same databases:

        * `absent` — run the one-shot;
        * `partial` — reset the half-written schemas FIRST, then run. Re-running
          the importer over a schema that already exists reported success in 28
          seconds and left `acore_world` permanently unimportable (measured on
          yulon-ubuntu, 2026-08-23);
        * `imported`, or `populated` with every schema complete — skip. A resume
          must not touch a finished import, and rows alone are not failure:
          modules seed them;
        * `unreadable`, or `populated` but incomplete — refuse. An unanswerable
          database is not an empty one, and a database with rows in it is
          somebody's.

        `unreadable` means what it says here only because `start-db` ran first:
        the probe reaches the databases through `docker exec` on the database
        container, so without one running it answers `unreadable` for a machine
        with nothing wrong with it. See `stage_start_db()`.

        The five-branch table ALWAYS runs first (A7). With `service` given the
        compose one-shot and `verify_import` follow, as before; with `service`
        None this returns after the table and the family applies the SQL
        itself, re-probes and writes its own marker (7.3).

        """Wait for the world server, giving a server that is still TALKING more time.

        **`ready.timeout_s` is a quiet budget, not a total one.** It is how long
        the world server may print NOTHING NEW before this calls it stuck; every
        time it prints, the budget starts again. That is the whole fix, and the
        incident that forced it was measured on yulon-win11-gate 2026-09-04 from
        the world server's own timestamps (`docker logs -t`), with the server
        directory on Docker Desktop's 9p share reading at about 1.4 MB/s:

            Vanilla  06:12:43Z mangosd start -> 06:37:22Z first `Avg Diff:` = 24.6 min
            TBC      18:59:55Z mangosd start -> 19:45:58Z first `Avg Diff:` = 46.0 min

        Both entries carried `timeout_s: 1800`, so the first fitted and the
        second did not. TBC's install ended `The server started but never
        reported ready`, exit 1, while `tbc-mangosd` was up, had `restarts=0`,
        had loaded its world and went on printing its diff loop for hours. The
        install was complete and correct; only the verdict was wrong. The two
        games differ in how much world is being read over that mount and in
        nothing else, so no fixed wall-clock number can be right on both a
        native Linux disk and a 9p share — while "has it said anything in the
        last half hour" means the same thing on both.

        Structure: `wait_ready()` is called for one `timeout_s` window at a
        time, and between windows `world_output` is asked what the container
        has said. A window that ends without the banner is read against
        `_read_world()`'s questions, which holds the order and the argument for
        it — and which `wait_ready_quietly()` shares, so the six management
        waits cannot drift into a different one. This loop's own job is the
        three things a bool cannot carry: the announcement, the progress notes,
        and a separate sentence per verdict — including the one that says
        NOTHING about the server, because docker stopped answering and this
        wait's only view of the world is through it.

        Every duration in those sentences is MEASURED, off the `monotonic`
        seam, and none is assumed from the window count. `docker.wait_ready()`
        returns False early on three of its four paths, so a window handed
        thirty minutes can end in two — and until 2026-09-05 the note the user
        read said thirty minutes anyway (`(spent + 1) * quiet`), and the ceiling
        was twelve of those windows however short they were. RED on m910q that
        day: a fake whose windows ended at 120 s printed `Still loading after 30
        minutes` and gave up at 24 minutes of wall clock saying six hours.

        The ceiling (`READY_CEILING_SECONDS`) is the outer bound on a server
        that prints for ever, and it is now wall clock rather than a count of
        windows. The last window is shortened to whatever is left of it, so the
        wait spends at most the ceiling and never more — including for a
        `timeout_s` that does not divide it (2500 bought nine whole windows and
        overshot by fifteen minutes) and for one LARGER than it, which now buys
        one window of six hours instead of one of its own full length. The
        catalogue asking for longer than the ceiling does not raise the ceiling.

        **The banner is not the end of the wait** (T71). `docker.wait_ready()`
        answers True on the first match and used to end this generator with
        "The server is up."; `watch_after_ready()` then keeps looking for
        `READY_GRACE_SECONDS`, and a world that restarts, stops or prints its
        family's `fatal` line in that minute ends this stage in a failure that
        quotes what it said. Its constant holds the measurement.

        That failure is a `WorldStoppedAfterReadyError` and the others are not,
        which is the owner's answer of 2026-09-16 about what a REBUILD does with
        it: this one keeps the new build (the compile was fine; the server it
        made started), every pre-banner verdict below still rolls the images
        back. `rebuild()` is the only reader of the distinction.

        Two gaps inherited from `docker.wait_ready()`, recorded in 7.1 and still
        true: its crash-loop latch and its `fatal` search both look at the WORLD
        container only, so an auth container that loops or prints a fatal line
        is not seen. Both are conservative — slower to give up, never quicker to
        call a dead server ready.

        **Stop is heard within one poll (T247)**: `ctx.cancel` rides to the
        real wait on `docker.ReadySpec.cancel` and to the watch after the
        banner. A window the Stop cut short is never read as silence, but a
        verdict that is a failure in its own right -- a crash loop, a container
        gone, a fatal line, a world that stopped after its banner -- is still
        that failure: the Stop did not cause it. What the Stop then does:

        * plain (an install, the finish of a world update): `ReadyWaitStopped`
          at once, and the world is left loading;
        * `stop_lets_it_load` (a rebuild, which Update and Return run through;
          the lead's ruling of 2026-10-05): T158's rule, never kill a loading
          world. The Stop is said (`docker.STOP_WAITS_FOR_THE_LOAD`) and the
          wait goes on until the world is ready, crashes or runs out; ready and
          watched, it still raises (`READY_STOPPED_AFTER_LOADING`), because the
          player asked to stop; crashed in the watch, it raises
          `CrashedAfterStop`, which rolls back where T71 would keep the build.
          "Stop now anyway" ends it early (`READY_WAIT_STOPPED_ANYWAY`);
        * inside the watch after the banner, before its minute is over:
          `READY_STOPPED_IN_THE_WATCH`. In its last pause: the build met its
          proof first, so it is kept (`READY_STOP_TOO_LATE`).

        A caller that must not be stopped (the rollback's wait for the build it
        put back) passes a context with no cancel.

        The fix for bug-checklist §35, driven on real hardware 2026-09-02: a
        WoW TBC server this app installed on m910q was joined from another PC
        over Tailscale, auth succeeded, the realm list arrived, and the world
        connect could not — `realmd.realmlist.address` was still
        `127.0.0.1`, so the client had been told the world server was on its
        OWN machine and hung at "Connecting" saying nothing. One
        `UPDATE realmd.realmlist SET address='100.64.0.10' WHERE id=1` later
        the same client reached a character screen. Every piece of this existed
        (`networking.realmlist_sql()`, `CatalogEntry.realmlist`,
        `platform.detect_lan_ip()`, the Networking tab) and nothing on the
        install path ever ran any of it, so EVERY server this app installed was
        unreachable from every other machine until somebody found that tab.

        Here rather than in a family, because all four shipped games have a
        `realmlist` block and all four had the bug. NOT a stage: `STAGE_NAMES`
        is pinned by equality tests in two families, a new name would be
        written into every state file in the wild, and a step that must run on
        every resume would have to be `recorded=False` anyway — which is to say
        it would be this, with a name.

        **Nothing here can fail the install, and that is the whole design.**
        By the time this runs the server is built, imported, started and has
        reported ready; the user has been promised a working server and has
        one. Five outcomes, one line each — and the first of them is a file.

        bug-checklist §41: the last four all end in the row being rewritten or
        in a reason it was not, and none of them could tell a row that says
        `127.0.0.1` because nobody set it from one that says `127.0.0.1`
        because the owner asked for it. The row cannot answer that — it is the
        same eight characters either way — so the answer is recorded intent,
        written by `networking.apply()` when the Networking tab's `loopback`
        mode was applied, and read here BEFORE anything else this method does.
        Before, and not after: on 2026-09-06 at `30671d6e` two mutations of this
        order were run on m910q from a fresh `git clone --shared` with
        `__pycache__` purged on both sides
        (`.notes/gates/bug41-loopback-2026-09-05/mutations-round3.txt`). Reading
        the intent after `self._detected_lan_ip()` still left the row alone, and
        reading it after the `address is None` return printed
        `REALM_ADDRESS_UNKNOWN` instead of the §41 sentence on a machine with no
        LAN address — the machine this mode exists for. Both kept
        `_statements()` and `sql_calls` empty, so the two empty lists in
        `test_spine.py::test_a_loopback_the_owner_chose_is_left_alone_and_the_line_says_why`
        hold nothing here; what holds it is that test's call-counting `lan_ip`
        seam plus
        `test_spine.py::test_the_machine_this_mode_is_for_has_no_lan_address_at_all`.

        * the owner CHOSE the loopback — nothing is detected, nothing is asked,
          nothing is sent, and the line says which file says so and how to undo
          it. A server whose loopback was never chosen has no such file and
          falls through to the four below, which is §41's other half;
        * no address — `REALM_ADDRESS_UNKNOWN`, and no SQL is attempted at all.
          A guess would be worse than the default, and a refusal would be a lie
          about what happened;
        * the row is ALREADY REACHABLE — nothing is sent. Not "already equal
          to the LAN address": equality is the wrong question, and asking it
          was a real defect. `networking.apply()` exists so a user can advertise
          a PUBLIC address for internet play, and every ordinary resume of the
          installer runs this method again. Comparing against the LAN address
          overwrote that public address with a LAN one and printed "players on
          other machines can reach this server", which was the opposite of what
          had just happened (review, 2026-09-03). The question that matters is
          whether the row can be reached from another machine at all, which is
          exactly what `networking.advertisable()` already answers;
        * the UPDATE failed — said, with what the database answered, plus where
          to fix it by hand. The install stays successful;
        * it worked — said, naming the address, because the address is what the
          user has to type into their client next.

    """What is in `folder`, minus `ignoring` — or a refusal, never a bare `OSError`.

    THE ONLY PLACE THIS ENGINE DECIDES WHETHER A FOLDER IS ITS TO WRITE INTO.
    That is narrower than what this line said until 2026-09-05 — "THE ONLY
    PLACE THIS ENGINE LISTS A DIRECTORY" — which was true of no commit that
    ever carried it. `families/clientdir.py` walks a client's `Data/` in
    `_to_depth()` and `locale_dirs()`, `families/extract.py` counts what a tool
    produced in `file_count()`, and `families/sqlplan.py` lists `Updates/` in a
    second private function of this very name. Those three READ a folder
    somebody else filled and deliberately let the `OSError` out to a caller
    with a better sentence for it than this one has — `mpq_files()` says so in
    as many words, because `rglob()` answering short would reach the user as
    "too few archives" about a folder nobody could open. Rewording was the fix
    rather than routing them through here: they need `Path`s and the raw error,
    and this function exists to hand back names and a refusal.

    The narrow claim is pinned by enumeration rather than by assertion:
    `test_every_folder_listing_in_the_package_is_accounted_for` lists every
    directory listing under `yulon/` in eight spellings — `iterdir`, `scandir`,
    `listdir`, `glob`, `iglob`, `rglob`, `walk`, `fwalk`, at module level and
    inside `async def` too — with the reason each is not a write decision, so a
    new one anywhere in the app fails that audit rather than quietly making this
    paragraph false again. It read two modules until 2026-09-05, which is how a
    sentence about the whole engine went unchecked over five sixths of it; then
    three spellings under `yulon/catalog/`, which a `glob` respelling of the
    very regression it was widened for walked straight past; then six, which
    `glob.iglob` walked past the same way. Eight is a set that can be checked,
    and `test_the_listing_audit_sees_every_spelling_it_names` checks it — not a
    claim to read every spelling Python has, which is what the set's own
    docstring said both times it was wrong.

    Not every listed site is exonerated: `apply.py`'s `_require_own_clone()`
    makes THIS decision — may the module applier write into this clone dir —
    with a bare `iterdir()` and no `except` at all, so an unreadable clone dir
    reaches the user as a `PermissionError` traceback (measured, m910q
    2026-09-05). It is recorded in that map as a defect rather than a design,
    and filed; the sentence at the top of this docstring is about the INSTALL
    engine and stays true.

    The caller that made the point was `installer.cancelled_install_message()`,
    which decided with a bare `iterdir()` whether the folder the user just
    stopped an install in has leftovers — `_claim_folder()`'s question, asked
    by the copy that tells the user what `_claim_folder()` will do. Two answers
    to one question, and they could differ on exactly the folder that matters,
    the one neither can read. It comes through here now, and both answers are
    driven on one unreadable folder in
    `test_a_folder_the_copy_cannot_list_is_refused_rather_than_called_empty`.

    Four sites asked `folder.iterdir()` bare until 2026-09-02 — `_claim_folder()`, which every
    shipped game reaches through preflight and `_guard()`;
    `stage_clone_sources()`, which the three CMaNGOS games bind; and
    AzerothCore's `_clone_core()` and `_clone_modules()` — and reproduced
    through the real `install_wiring.main()` at all four, an unreadable folder
    printed a `PermissionError` traceback where the harness's own docstring
    promises the sentence written for a person. At the three stage sites
    `run()`'s `except InstallerError` could not see it either, so
    `_record_error` never ran and the state file kept `"last_error": ""`. That
    is the same shape as the `composegen.render()` blocker (`b22ab381`), and
    the same fix: translate where the call is.

    REFUSE, never assume empty. A listing that fails says nothing about what is
    in there, and the caller's next move on "empty" is a clone whose seam
    `shutil.rmtree`s a destination it does not recognise. Treating an
    unreadable folder as empty would delete a user's files on exactly the input
    where the engine knows least — the same trade `_claim_folder()` makes for a
    state file it cannot parse.

    Not exotic, either: `iterdir()` raises for a permission change, an
    unreadable mount, a drive that went away, and a stale UNC path into a WSL
    distro — the app reaches folders that way often enough that
    `Identification.UNVERIFIED` exists in the UI for it.

    `ignoring` is a single name that does not count as content, which is
    `STATE_FILE` at three of the four sites; `_clone_modules()` passes nothing,
    because a module directory holding this app's state file would be a
    leftover worth refusing over.

    Raises:
        InstallerError: the folder could not be listed. The sentence names the
            folder, carries what the OS said, and is distinct from every
            "this folder has files in it" refusal above it.
