"""The install spine: named, resumable stages, game-free (roadmap 6.2 → 7.1).

One typed engine for every server on every platform. `StagedInstaller` owns
what is true of every install — the state file and its hint semantics, the
directory/ownership guard, preflight and Docker provisioning, the
refuse-not-delete clone safety, the compose marker rules, streaming, cancel
copy, keep-awake — and a FAMILY (`families/azerothcore.py`, `families/cmangos.py`)
composes its stages into an ordered tuple. `installer.installer_for()` picks
the family from `catalog.json`'s `install.native.family`. Every family engine
has the same contract (`run(options, *, cancel, ask) -> Iterator[str]`), so the
catalog view, the log panel and the job runner need no changes.

**Staged and resumable.** The stages are recorded by NAME in
`.yulon-install.json`, so reordering them can never re-interpret an existing
install. The rules below each cost the earlier Rust launcher an evening
(`pyplan/rust-prior-art.md` §1), and they are the reason this file is more
careful than its length suggests:

* preflight and the guard are not stages: the spine runs them itself, so a
  family can neither forget nor record them — a guard a resume skips is not a
  guard. A `Stage` with `recorded=False` (`start-db`, `up`, `ready`) is run by
  every resume: an install must end by actually starting and verifying the
  server, and the database must be back up before the import can ask it
  anything.
* **The state file is a hint, and disk evidence answers in both directions.**
  Every stage re-checks disk evidence before skipping: the clone stages ask git
  for the remote, the build asks the daemon for images, compose generation
  reads its own marker. An `is_done` short-circuit once let a state file
  dropped into a directory make the generator rewrite a real server's compose
  file and orphan its character volumes. The converse is just as load-bearing
  and was missing until 7.1: a stage that is recorded AND corroborated must be
  a genuine no-op, because "re-run it to be sure" is destructive for a clone —
  see `StagedInstaller.already_cloned()`.
* `install_id` is a hash of the ABSOLUTE server directory, so a COPIED install
  directory is refused rather than adopted; `family` is recorded too, so a
  catalog edit that moves a game between families is a refusal, never a
  reinterpretation.
* A failure mid-stage records nothing, so the stage re-runs.
* A stage's cancel note is said by the spine, right after `--- <name>`, and
  by nothing else.

**Nothing on this path prompts for its own decisions.** Exactly two questions
pass THROUGH it, both inside Docker provisioning before stage 1 and both via
the forwarded `ask`: the docker-group consent and, on Linux, the sudo password.
A stage that turns out to need an answer is a design failure to fix rather
than a dialog to add.

**Verified where, exactly.** Everything here is unit-tested against seams;
docstrings say which claims are inherited from the Rust launcher's incidents,
which are measured on yulon-ubuntu (Linux), and which are merely written.

"""What a Stop costs, said before it is pressed, and true of every stage.

The sentence this replaced was about the build (see `BUILD_CANCEL_NOTE`) and
was said as the second line of every install and appended to every
cancellation, so a user who stopped during the clone or the download was told
Docker was finishing a build step (review, 2026-08-23).

**This sentence has been rewritten until every clause names something a stage
is responsible for keeping, because each version claimed more than the engine
does.** It said "only the step that was interrupted runs again" while the live
Ubuntu gate (2026-08-30) printed `Already finished: clone-core, clone-modules,
generate-compose` and ran all three, each doing `git fetch` + `git reset --hard
FETCH_HEAD` over the user's source. It said the source was "left exactly as it
is on disk", which is false of `docker-compose.yml` — a TRACKED file of the
emulator checkout, carrying this engine's marker after the first install, so
`composegen.write_plan()` puts it back whenever it differs. It said only the
last steps run every time, while `start-db` sits mid-list with `recorded=False`
and `client-data` consults no state at all. And it opened with "nothing is
written outside the folder below", three lines above `Docker setup did:
apt-get update; apt-get install -y docker.io; systemctl enable --now docker;
usermod -aG docker pk` — a reassurance printed directly above the actions
contradicting it, which is the exact shape of the sentence removed from the
clone stage (review, 2026-08-31).

So each clause is now a claim something is responsible for keeping:

* *what goes outside this folder* — the base template's two NAMED volumes
  (`db-data`, `client-data`) plus the built images, which is why
  `preflight.evaluate()` has a check about Docker's data root and not only
  about this drive; `platform.ensure_docker()` for the second item, whose own
  `done` steps are printed a few lines below this one; and `config_dir()` for
  the third;
* *finished cloning is never fetched, reset or moved* — `already_cloned()`, and
  `refuse_unowned_checkout()` for the checkout that was never this app's;
* *the build is not run a second time once Docker confirms its images* —
  `stage_build()`, where an unknown answer rebuilds rather than skips;
* *the compose files this app writes are put back* — said, not hidden, because
  `write_plan()` really does overwrite an edit to a file it wrote;
* *the download resumes and re-checks itself* — the generated entrypoint's
  `curl --continue-at -` plus its data-version comparison;
* *the database and server are started and waited for* — the three
  `recorded=False` stages, which is why a resume always ends with a live server.

Owner answer 2 (2026-09-08): *always keep a rollback, and restore it

new image over the tag the running containers were created from, so the old
build is gone the moment the compile finishes unless it has a second name
first. This is that name: `<ref>-rollback`, one per image in
`composegen.built_image_refs()`. It is the recipe that brought m910q's Tortoise
back on the night of 2026-09-08 -- `docker tag` before, retag and recreate after
-- done by hand then and by `StagedInstaller.rebuild()` now.

A suffix on the TAG rather than a second repository name, so `docker images`

find the leftover by the same rule.

FAILED_TAG_SUFFIX = "-failed"

Added on the adversarial review of 2026-09-08. The restore moves one tag at a

old build and the rest on the new -- a server nobody has run, reported as if
it were one thing. Giving the new build its own name BEFORE any tag moves is
what makes a failure part-way undoable: the refs already moved are moved back
onto this name, and "the tags still name the new build" is then true of all of
them. Removed once the restore has settled either way.

**Letting it go takes two attempts, and that is measured rather than defensive.**
The first runs the moment the tags are back, while the containers made FROM the
new build are still there, and docker refuses to remove a name whose image a
container references -- so on `yulon-ubuntu2`, 2026-09-09, exactly the two
long-running services came back `conflict: unable to delete ... (must be forced)
- container 31769acad1c4 is using its referenced image` while the two one-shots
(whose containers were not recreated at all) were removed and their images
deleted. Half a broken build kept for ever under a name documented as transient
is not a state anybody chose, so `_restore_rollback` asks again after its own

    generates no compose files, downloads nothing and runs no import. Its own
    docstring records what it cost to have one sentence claim more than the
    stages keep, so the rule is the same — every clause names something
    `rebuild_stages()` is responsible for, and the list is exactly as long as
    that tuple precisely so it stays checkable.

    It is a function and not a constant because the tuple stopped being one
    length on 2026-09-09: the families that render their own Dockerfile now
    write it again from the current template before compiling (T8), and the
    families whose checkout ships one do not. A single constant would have had
    to claim the re-render for WotLK, where nothing does it, or hide it from
    the three CMaNGOS games, where it is the point of the press — and "this
    does three things and nothing else" is the kind of clause that goes quietly
    false rather than red.

    back on every failure and every cancel that lands before the containers are
    replaced. Narrowing the sentence to "the containers stay as they are" was
    the alternative and is worse: a user who stops a press would be left with a
    build recipe they never agreed to, and the next compile — which may be
    somebody else's press, hours later — would silently produce a different

— `pyplan/checklist.md`, under 7.7 — because it is a policy argued from
evidence rather than a measurement, and the owner may want it wider, narrower,
or replaced by a fourth run.

THE ARGUMENT. Round 4 put the floor exactly on the slowest sample, and a review
answered it in one line: 3703 s is refused. A bound with zero margin over a
single sample of a noisy quantity is a bound that will refuse the first healthy
boot slightly slower than the one boot anybody happened to time. The three
measurements are the only thing available to size the margin with, and what
they show is the spread ACROSS the servers this project ships on one box and one
share: 1479 -> 2763 -> 3702, a factor of 2.50 end to end and 1.87 between the
widest-separated neighbours. So the margin is the widest gap the evidence
actually exhibits, applied once above the slowest thing in it — i.e. the next
server, or the next box, is assumed to sit no further above Tortoise than TBC
sits above Vanilla.

WHAT IT DOES NOT MEASURE, said plainly: nothing here is run-to-run variance.
These are three DIFFERENT servers, timed once each; nobody has booted the same
server twice on 9p, so the project has no number for how much one server varies
between runs, and this margin is a stand-in for a quantity that has never been
measured. That is the weakness the owner is being asked to rule on, and the way
to close it is a second run of one of these three rather than an argument.

WHY NOT THE INSTALL CEILING'S RULE. `READY_CEILING_SECONDS` sits 5.8 times
clear of the same slowest boot, and copying that here would bound the 480 s
AzerothCore callers at six hours — the exact collapse of the two ceilings that
`MANAGEMENT_CEILING_WINDOWS` exists to undo. The two bounds answer different
failures: the install ceiling stops a server that talks for ever, and this
floor stops a management wait refusing one that was going to finish.

The install gets `READY_CEILING_SECONDS`. The two waits are bounded by different
things and collapsing them was a regression: an INSTALL is a long operation the
user started knowing it was long and which streams progress the whole way, and
six hours is there only so a server printing rubbish for ever cannot hang it.
Between 2026-09-04 and 2026-09-05 the management waits took the install's
ceiling, so a call that used to be bounded at 480 s, 1800 s or 10800 s could
block for six hours whatever its caller asked for, and nothing tested the change.

TWO, because two is the whole claim this constant makes: a budget spent once is
not a budget, and that single-shot reading is the bug this lane exists for. It
is not the number that decides any shipped ceiling today, and that is asserted
rather than hoped — `test_the_management_ceiling_is_the_floor_or_the_cap_for_every_budget_shipped`
walks `catalog.json` and fails the day an entry lands in the band
(3458 s < `timeout_s` < 10800 s) where `timeout * WINDOWS` is what answers. At
that point somebody has to own the multiple with a measurement.

HOW FAR THAT GOES, measured rather than claimed (m910q 2026-09-05, this file's
whole test module at each value): 1 is red (two tests, one of them a real-path
wait that goes back to spending the budget once), 2 and 3 are both green, and 4,
5 and 11 are red (the floor-or-cap audit plus the last-window shortening). So
the constant is owned to a band of exactly two values and a docstring arguing
for one of them over the other would be a confident reason with nothing behind
it. The band was a single value, 2, until 2026-09-05: raising the floor to
`MANAGEMENT_FLOOR_SECONDS` moved 1800 * 3 = 5400 s from above the floor to
below it, and a bound nothing reaches is a bound nothing can measure. That is a
real cost of the margin, recorded here rather than left for the next reader to
find with a mutation.

WHO ACTUALLY CALLS ONE. Not the Server tab's Stop/Start buttons: an earlier
version of this docstring rested the size on them and they do not wait —
`yulon/ui/controller_view.py:998` and `:1006` call `controller.start` and
`.stop`, neither of which asks whether the server came up. Measured 2026-09-05
by grepping the tree: outside `native.py` and `docker.py` every `wait_ready` /
`wait_server_ready` is a definition or prose, and the only code that RUNS one is
`pyplan/gates/gate-79-controller-surface.py`, three times per run (lines 219,
414, 487). Its worst case — a server that keeps printing and never says ready —
is therefore three ceilings:

    game          budget    ceiling   3 x ceiling   was, single-shot
    wow-wotlk       480 s    6916 s        5.8 h          24 min
    wow-tbc        1800 s    6916 s        5.8 h           1.5 h
    wow-vanilla    1800 s    6916 s        5.8 h           1.5 h
    wow-tortoise  10800 s   21600 s         18 h             9 h

Those are the numbers this change costs, written down because the round that
introduced a management ceiling quoted only the flattering end of its own
arithmetic. The first three rows read 3702 s and 3.1 h for one day: that was
`MANAGEMENT_FLOOR_SECONDS` sitting exactly on the slowest measured boot, with
no margin, which a review refuted by refusing a 3703 s boot. The margin is
1.87x and the price of it is the difference between those two columns.
A quiet server still ends its wait after ONE window (`_read_world()`
answers `quiet` the moment two readings match), so none of this is paid by a
server that is merely down — only by one that talks for ever.

Tortoise is the row worth reading twice. Its `timeout_s` was widened to 10800
on 2026-09-05 (`eb5f3b3f`, the 7.7 gate), and at that size ANY multiple of two
or more lands on `READY_CEILING_SECONDS`, so its management ceiling and the
install's are the same six hours and cannot be separated without giving it a
single window. That is a property of the catalogue number, not of this constant:
10800 s was measured as a stage TOTAL and is read here as how long the server may
say NOTHING, and nothing has ever measured three hours of Tortoise silence.
Narrowing it belongs to whoever owns `catalog.json`'s `ready` block; recorded
here so the next reader does not have to re-derive it.

    install's containers exist only inside the distro: `docker inspect` on the
    host answers "No such object", `container_state()` turns that into a
    default `ContainerState()`, and this comes back `WorldOutput("", None, "")`
    — "docker would not talk" — for a container that is up and printing. Two of
    those in a row end the wait. Until 2026-09-05 `wait_ready_quietly()`
    forwarded the distro to the WAIT and called this without it, so the wait
    watched one daemon while the verdict came from another. RED on m910q
    2026-09-05, from the docker guard added to `tests/conftest.py` that day:
    `test_wait_helpers_forward_the_distro_a_wsl_install_lives_in` — a test whose
    whole subject is that the distro is forwarded — was passing while it ran
    `['docker', 'inspect', 't-world', ...]` against the box's own daemon.

    `container_state()` first, and its `started_at` is handed to the log read:
    that is what scopes the log to the CURRENT run, without which a restarted
    server's previous run — its old ready banner included — is still sitting
    there (`docker._logs`, measured 2026-08-22). It also means the restart count
    and the text come from the same look at the machine.

    `docker._logs()` rather than a public function because there is none: that
    module's only public log reader is `follow_logs()`, which streams
    `docker logs -f` and does not return. The same reach as
    `ABANDONED_WORKER_SECONDS`' into `runner`, and for the same reason — naming
    the real thing beats copying it.

    An EMPTY `status` is how this recognises "could not ask", and that is read
    off the value rather than caught as an exception. Until 2026-09-05 the
    unknown case was an `except docker.DockerCommandError` around both calls,
    and NEITHER of them raises it: `container_state()` logs "could not read the
    state of ..." and returns a default `ContainerState()` on a non-zero
    inspect, `_logs()` logs and returns `""`, and `_docker()` turns even a
    missing CLI into a non-zero `CompletedProcess` rather than an exception (its
    docstring says so, and gives the reason). So the branch that produced
    `restarts=None` was unreachable, and every failed inspect arrived as the
    fabricated `restarts=0` that `WorldOutput`'s own docstring forbids — a crash
    loop underneath an unaskable daemon would have run out the whole ceiling.
    RED on m910q 2026-09-05: `assert 0 is None`, from a `container_state` double
    that answers the way the real one does.

    `text` is the one field with no unknown value: `_logs()` answers `""` both
    for "the log could not be read" and for "the container has printed nothing
    yet", and docker offers nothing to tell those apart. A state that reads and
    a log that does not therefore looks like a silent container, which
    `wait_for_ready()` refuses after one quiet budget. That is the conservative
    direction (it never calls a dead server ready) and it is the reason the
    state is read FIRST: the failure that takes both down at once — no daemon —

container thirty restarts past the threshold, and `_read_world()` asks the
crash-loop question first, so it never reached the status at all. Adding
`paused` left it green too. Against the file as it now stands both go red, and

    and `wait_ready_quietly()`, which turns it into a bool. Two copies of an
    ordering is two orderings the day one of them is edited.

    The order is the whole content, and it is not the order the questions were
    asked in until 2026-09-05:

    * **crash loop** first. A looping container reports `restarting`, so any
      "is it still there" test that runs before this one answers for it, and a
      loop gets named a stop. `restarts` grown by `restart_loop` since the FIRST
      readable count; `None` on either side is "could not ask" and counts
      towards nothing.
    * **gone** second: a status outside `_ALIVE_STATUSES`. It is still ahead of
      the log-based questions, because an exited container is silent too and
      "it exited" is the better sentence.
    * **fatal** third: `markers.fatal` matched HERE as well as inside
      `docker.wait_ready()`, so the refusal can quote the line the server
      printed rather than the alternation from the catalog.
    * **quiet** last: this reading identical to the last. Any change at all
      counts as life, a shrinking log included — a log that shrank means the
      container restarted or `docker logs` failed, and both are better answered
      by the questions above than by declaring silence.

    "quiet" splits in two on the STATUS, and that split is a sentence rather
    than a decision: both end the wait. `WorldOutput.status` is `""` only when
    `container_state()` could not read the container at all, and two identical
    unreadable readings are `unreadable` — docker stopped answering — not
    `quiet`. Until 2026-09-05 a daemon that died mid-wait was reported as "it
    stopped printing anything at all ... so this one is stuck rather than slow",
    which contradicts the announcement printed moments earlier (this wait is
    watching the log; it had not read the log) and sends the user to
    `docker compose logs`, the one command that cannot work either. Nothing was

    The bool half of `StagedInstaller.wait_for_ready()`, and the reason it
    exists is that one catalogue number was being read two ways. The install
    spine spends `install.native.ready.timeout_s` as a window that restarts
    every time the world server prints; six other waits — the base
    `controller.Controller.wait_ready()`, `TortoiseController.wait_ready()` and
    the four `docker_ctl.wait_server_ready()` — built a `ReadySpec` from the
    same field and waited it out ONCE, as a fixed total wall clock. That is the
    reading the incident of 2026-09-04 disproved: TBC's world server took 46.0
    minutes to its first `Avg Diff:` against a `timeout_s` of 1800 while
    printing the whole way, and every one of those six sites would have called
    it a failure at 30 minutes exactly as the installer did.

    So the number has one meaning in this app now, and it is this one. The
    alternative was to rename the field, which needs `catalog.py` and
    `catalog.json` — not this lane's to edit — and would have left six sites
    spending a budget under a name that said they should not.

    **The call is bounded**, by `management_ceiling(ready.timeout)`: at least
    `MANAGEMENT_CEILING_WINDOWS` of the caller's windows, never shorter than
    `MANAGEMENT_FLOOR_SECONDS`, never longer than
    `READY_CEILING_SECONDS`. So `timeout=` shortens the call only down to that
    measured floor, and deliberately: the two callers on
    `docker.azerothcore_ready()`'s 480 s default were bounded at 1920 s between
    2026-09-04 and 2026-09-05, which is shorter than every 9p first boot this
    project has measured, and refusing a server that was about to succeed is the
    defect this file is here to remove rather than to relocate.

    `wait`, `output` and `monotonic` are resolved at CALL time, never bound as
    defaults: `docker.wait_ready_for` bound at import is a function a test's
    `monkeypatch` can no longer replace, and most of those sites are tested
    that way.

    `wsl_distro` reaches the WAIT and both READS. It reached only the wait until
    2026-09-05; `_world_output()`'s docstring has what that cost.

    Returns True the moment the world server reports ready. Returns False for
    every one of `_read_world()`'s verdicts and at the ceiling, because a
    caller polling a running server wants a bool — the five sentences are the
    install spine's job, and it keeps its own loop to build them.

    A docker that will not answer at all needs no special case here, and one was
    written and then deleted: `WorldOutput("", None, "")` twice running is the
    `unreadable` verdict, so an unreachable daemon already ends this after one
    window — exactly what the single-shot wait it replaced did. The guard that
    checked for it explicitly survived its own mutation on m910q 2026-09-05
    (`if False:`, whole file still green) and differed from having no guard in
    only one case: a daemon that was unreachable for the first look and

    see. A branch whose only distinct behaviour is the wrong one.

        AzerothCore because that checkout ships its own Dockerfile, so its
        family has no such stage and `stage_named()` would refuse every WotLK
        rebuild by name. `rebuild_confirmation()` reads the same fact off the
        entry, and `test_the_confirmation_promises_the_re_render_for_exactly_the_games_that_get_it`
        binds the two derivations across every shipped entry.

        `recreate` is this tuple's own stage rather than the install's `up`,
        and `docker.staged_up_argv()` holds the argument: `up -d` was measured
        to replace a container whose CONFIGURATION changed, and a rebuild
        changes neither the compose files nor the image tag. Never recorded --
        `up` is not either, and a rebuild must not be able to leave a state file
        claiming a stage the install's own resume would then skip. The re-render
        keeps the family's own `recorded=True` for the opposite reason: it is
        the install's stage, run with the install's body, and it really did
        happen.

        printed by the Modules tab after 20 of the 41 shipped manifests -- and
        which nothing in `yulon/ui/` offered until 2026-09-08.

        **Why re-pressing Install was never it.** `stage_build()` skips the
        compile when the state file records a build and the daemon holds every
        image, and `composegen.image_tag()` is derived from the FOLDER, so
        adding a module changes no tag and the images all still exist. Measured
        through this app's own predicates on yulon-ubuntu: `state.has("build")`
        True, `built_images()` True, `build_would_be_skipped()` True. A user who
        pressed Install again got a few seconds of output and no change, which
        is very probably what "i used the this thing to rebuild the server but
        nothing changes when i log back in" (2026-09-07) is a report of.

        **What it deliberately does not do: SQL.** One press does the compile
        and the restart, and touches no database. Three reasons, in the order
        they decided it:

        1. a database write behind a confirmation whose entire subject is a
           compile is a write nobody agreed to, and it would leave no way to ask
           for the compile alone -- which is what somebody re-testing a build
           wants;
        2. the databases here hold a player's characters. Every other path in
           this app that writes to them (`repair_import`, `restore`) is a
           separate, separately-confirmed action, and one of them arms on two
           presses;
        3. the reported reason it would be unnecessary is CARRIED, not
           verified here: AzerothCore applies a module's SQL through its own
           updater for the modules in `AC_MODULES_LIST`, which CMake bakes in
           at configure time, so a module compiled in by this rebuild is in
           that list from this build onward. Nothing in this repository
           measures that, and nothing in this function depends on it -- the
           closing line tells the user to look rather than promising it
           happened.

            InstallerError: any refusal (see `_refuse_unless_rebuildable`), any

        the compile is about to overwrite, and this keeps the two files the
        re-render is about to overwrite. Both are taken before anything runs and
        both exist so that a press stopped early leaves the machine as it was.

        Bytes, not text: what has to go back is what was there, and a read/write
        round trip through `str` would rewrite a file's line endings on Windows
        and call it a restore.

        **THREE answers, and it had two.** Until round 2 of T8's review every
        `OSError` became `None`, and `None` means "there was no file, so remove
        the one the re-render made". Traced by the cold reviewer: a `Dockerfile`
        this process cannot READ (a permission, a directory in its place)
        answered `None`, `write-dockerfile` then refused it as `UNREADABLE`
        saying "Nothing was touched", and the restore deleted the user's file
        and reported "put back exactly as it was". On Windows the `unlink`
        raised `PermissionError` instead -- not an `InstallerError`, so it flew
        past `_let_go` and left the rollback tags on the daemon. "Could not ask"
        is not "was not there", which is the same rule `_keep_rollback` applies
        to `images_built()` returning `None` one method above.

        The import is local because `families/dockerfile.py` imports `Secrets`
        from this module; `installer.py` breaks the same cycle the same way. The
        names are taken from it rather than restated here, so a rename is one
        edit and not a silent drift into restoring a file nobody writes.

        record, and `_guard()` refused the retry with "is not empty and was not
        created by this app" -- a sentence that was false, this app having
        written every byte, and whose only remedy was deleting a part-finished
        multi-gigabyte clone by hand. Driven, not reasoned: the TBC-on-Windows
        gate was killed mid-clone on `yulon-win11` (2026-09-03) and refused its
        own 162 MB checkout on the next attempt.

        **And that one failure is the one this still does not fix.** Measured
        on m910q 2026-09-05: `_clone_core()` clones into the SERVER DIR, and
        both seams in `git.py` (`RunnerGit.clone`, `ContainerGit.clone`) begin
        by emptying a destination that has no `.git` -- so the record written
        below is removed at the start of stage one on every fresh install, kill
        or no kill. Three tests in `test_families_azerothcore.py` asserted
        otherwise and passed only because their clone doubles skipped that
        line; with the doubles made faithful (`as_the_clone_seam_does()`) all
        three went red, and they now say what happens. What this method DOES
        buy is every stage after the first: their destinations are under
        `modules/`, the record survives them, and the retry resumes. Closing
        the rest means changing where `clone-core` clones -- `git clone <url>
        <dir>` refuses a directory that is not empty, which is why the seam
        empties it -- and that is a `git.py` change with a live gate behind it,
        not a patch here.

        **`5eef8d9f` recorded it on the `except InstallerError` path instead,
        and an adversarial review the same day was right that this misses the
        failure that produced it.** SIGKILL, a power cut and an unhandled
        exception never reach an `except` block, so the harshest endings -- the
        ones a person actually meets -- still left an unclaimed folder. A claim
        that only survives a cooperative failure is a claim about the easy case.

        **Why the early write is safe, which is what §38 thought was the
        obstacle.** The bug list recorded that three tests forbid writing before
        stage one, two of them because an install into the USER'S OWN git
        checkout must leave that checkout untouched, and concluded that the
        "whose checkout is this" question had to be moved ahead of the claim
        first. Re-read on 2026-09-03: it is already ahead. `_guard()` refuses
        every non-empty folder outright, with ONE deliberate exception -- a
        directory holding `.git`, deferred so the clone stage can say whose fork
        it is instead of "this folder is not empty". So the only folder that
        reaches stage one non-empty and unclaimed is somebody's checkout, and
        `started_empty` is exactly the predicate that excludes it. All three
        tests drive a `.git` directory; none of them constrains an empty folder.

        `started_empty` is also no longer a fact carried across the whole
        install to be used at the end. It is read and acted on in consecutive
        statements, which is as narrow as the window gets without a lock: the
        review's point that a second install, a dropped-in file or a remount
        could invalidate it stands, and is now a race of microseconds rather
        than of hours.

        **A failure to claim is a refusal, not a shrug.** The late version had
        to be silent -- it ran with an `InstallerError` already in flight, so
        anything it raised replaced the sentence the user was about to read.
        Nothing is in flight here. A folder this app cannot write a 200-byte
        JSON file into is a folder the install cannot succeed in, and saying so
        now costs one attempt instead of one clone.

        Nothing is written when the folder is not ours to fill, and nothing when
        a record already exists: a resume must not overwrite the progress it is

        `_guard()`. Until 2026-09-02 every rule here ran only in the second
        place, which is after `ensure_docker()` -- a sudo password, the

        said. `7cb3bf17` hoisted the one sibling rule that lives in
        `platform.server_dir_problem()` and left these below it.

        Nothing here writes, deletes or asks anything outside this directory,

        Answered by `read_claim()`, which is the same function `_guard()` asks,
        because the previous two answers to this question disagreed. This one
        used to be `(ctx.server_dir / STATE_FILE).is_file()` — PRESENCE — on the
        premise that `_guard()` had already proved that any state file still
        here belongs to this install. The premise held only for a file
        `_guard()` could parse: every check there is written `if existing is not
        None and …`, and `read_state()` answered `None` for a file it could not
        read. So a corrupt state file passed `_guard()` as "fresh folder" and
        passed this as "ours", and `refuse_unowned_checkout()` stood down over a
        user's own checkout. `read_claim()`'s docstring has the repro.

        Three answers, and only `OWNED` is ownership. `UNKNOWN` is a state file
        that is there and unreadable, and it must never be worth more than
        `UNCLAIMED`, which is no file at all: it is the input the engine knows
        least about. `_guard()` refuses `UNKNOWN` before a stage runs, so
        reaching it here means the file was damaged or replaced DURING the
        install — which is exactly why this re-reads the folder rather than
        trusting a decision taken minutes ago.

        `ctx.state` cannot answer it either: `_guard()` hands every run a state
        object whether or not a file was read, so a fresh install and a resumed
        one are indistinguishable from the object alone. What `ctx.state` is
        good for is the identity `_guard()` already validated, which is what the
        re-read is checked against here.

        it was reached by a first press rather than a resume. `_guard()`
        deliberately exempts a directory that is a git checkout from the
        not-empty refusal, so that a clone stage can say whose repository it is
        instead of "this folder is not empty" — but the clone stages only ever
        refused a checkout of a DIFFERENT repository. Point a first install at
        your own checkout of the same repo and every guard passed: no record, so
        `already_cloned()` is False, so the seam's update path ran, which is
        `git fetch` + `git reset --hard FETCH_HEAD`. Driven end to end (review,
        2026-08-31): `// my patch` became `// upstream`.

        Ownership is `claimed_this_folder()`, and only `Ownership.OWNED` is it.
        INSIDE a folder this install owns, an unrecorded checkout is this
        install's own unfinished work and fetch+reset is the right repair — that
        is how a `modules/` clone that died half way is healed. Outside one, it
        is somebody's repository and this app did not put it there, so it is
        named and left alone. `UNKNOWN` — a state file that is there and will
        not parse — is not ownership and gets its own sentence, because "there
        is no record here" would be a lie about a folder that has one.

        **`remote is None` is handled HERE, not at three call sites.** It used
        to `return` — safe only because
        `if has_git and existing is None: raise` was copy-pasted into
        `families/azerothcore.py` twice and `stage_clone_sources()` once, so
        the one method whose job is this could not do it alone (review,
        2026-08-31). Every one of those copies had the same `dest` this method
        is handed. `None` there does NOT mean "no checkout": it also means no
        docker CLI, a daemon that would not answer, a failed image pull, and —
        until `5c6c655c` — an SELinux denial on every enforcing box. A `.git`
        on disk is the host's own evidence that the container's `None` is a
        misdiagnosis, and stopping is the only safe reading of it.

        The cost is stated in the message rather than worked around: a FIRST
        clone that died before its stage was recorded also lands here, and the
        remedy is to delete the half-finished folder. Losing a download is not
        the same order of harm as losing work, and no evidence available at this
        point tells the two apart — a partly-cloned tree and a checkout a user
        made both answer `git remote get-url origin` with this exact URL.

        The two halves are the whole rule, and neither is sufficient alone.

        `InstallState.has()` is documented as "never a reason to skip on its
        own" because a state file can lie — a fresh empty folder once
        skip-compiled against another install's images — so the record is only
        ever a hint, and `remote` (what `git remote get-url origin` says at the
        destination, already checked against the source's URL by the caller) is
        the disk evidence that can contradict it.

        The other direction is what this method was missing until 7.1, and it
        cost the live Ubuntu gate (2026-08-30) its source tree: a clone that is
        recorded AND present was being handed to the seam anyway, where an
        existing `.git` means `git fetch` + `git reset --hard FETCH_HEAD`. That
        is destructive twice over. It discards any edit a user made to the
        server source, unrecoverably and with no warning; and it moves the
        checkout to whatever upstream has published since — so a user who stops
        a compile and starts it again does not resume the build they
        interrupted, they start a different one. A resume must not be able to
        change what is being built.

        `remote is None` with a record is the repair case and still clones: the
        checkout was deleted, or was never a checkout. A checkout with NO record
        is the other repair case — a run interrupted part-way through a clone —
        and fetch+reset is exactly right there, because a half-materialised
        working tree is not something to build against.

        `depends_on: <db>: condition: service_healthy` edge the generated base
        file declares on the import service.

        `pyplan/phase6-decisions.md` had already settled this for the repair
        button — "The action starts the database, and that is a deliberate
        widening of 'runs only the one-shot service'… Without it the action is
        unreachable" — and `docker.start_database()` is that same code, shared
        so the two paths cannot drift.

        Never recorded: it is a precondition, not progress, and it returns
        immediately when the container is already up.

        Unconditional (A7): every family's import needs the database up, and
        CMaNGOS has no `db_import` service at all. The AzerothCore family keeps
        its no-service short-circuit in its own wrapper.

        Five answers, four different things to do — `docker.DatabaseImport` is a
        five-member `Literal`, and `populated` splits on `complete`, joining
        `imported` on one side and `unreadable` on the other. That is why this
        count and the "five-branch table" below are different numbers. This
        opened "Four answers" until 2026-09-02, which read as a contradiction of
        its own closing paragraph and of `cmangos._import`. The branch table is
        `docker.repair_import()`'s, because an installer and a repair ask the
        same question of the same databases:

        * `absent` — run the one-shot;
        * `partial` — reset the half-written schemas FIRST, then run. Re-running
          the importer over a schema that already exists reported success in 28
          seconds and left `acore_world` permanently unimportable (measured on
          yulon-ubuntu, 2026-08-23);
        * `imported`, or `populated` with every schema complete — skip. A resume
          must not touch a finished import, and rows alone are not failure:
          modules seed them;
        * `unreadable`, or `populated` but incomplete — refuse. An unanswerable
          database is not an empty one, and a database with rows in it is
          somebody's.

        `unreadable` means what it says here only because `start-db` ran first:
        the probe reaches the databases through `docker exec` on the database
        container, so without one running it answers `unreadable` for a machine
        with nothing wrong with it. See `stage_start_db()`.

        The five-branch table ALWAYS runs first (A7). With `service` given the
        compose one-shot and `verify_import` follow, as before; with `service`
        None this returns after the table and the family applies the SQL
        itself, re-probes and writes its own marker (7.3).

        the world server may print NOTHING NEW before this calls it stuck; every
        time it prints, the budget starts again. That is the whole fix, and the
        incident that forced it was measured on yulon-win11-gate 2026-09-04 from
        the world server's own timestamps (`docker logs -t`), with the server
        directory on Docker Desktop's 9p share reading at about 1.4 MB/s:

            Vanilla  06:12:43Z mangosd start -> 06:37:22Z first `Avg Diff:` = 24.6 min
            TBC      18:59:55Z mangosd start -> 19:45:58Z first `Avg Diff:` = 46.0 min

        Both entries carried `timeout_s: 1800`, so the first fitted and the
        second did not. TBC's install ended `The server started but never
        reported ready`, exit 1, while `tbc-mangosd` was up, had `restarts=0`,
        had loaded its world and went on printing its diff loop for hours. The
        install was complete and correct; only the verdict was wrong. The two
        games differ in how much world is being read over that mount and in
        nothing else, so no fixed wall-clock number can be right on both a
        native Linux disk and a 9p share — while "has it said anything in the
        last half hour" means the same thing on both.

        Structure: `wait_ready()` is called for one `timeout_s` window at a
        time, and between windows `world_output` is asked what the container
        has said. A window that ends without the banner is read against
        `_read_world()`'s questions, which holds the order and the argument for
        it — and which `wait_ready_quietly()` shares, so the six management
        waits cannot drift into a different one. This loop's own job is the
        three things a bool cannot carry: the announcement, the progress notes,
        and a separate sentence per verdict — including the one that says
        NOTHING about the server, because docker stopped answering and this
        wait's only view of the world is through it.

        Every duration in those sentences is MEASURED, off the `monotonic`
        seam, and none is assumed from the window count. `docker.wait_ready()`
        returns False early on three of its four paths, so a window handed
        thirty minutes can end in two — and until 2026-09-05 the note the user
        read said thirty minutes anyway (`(spent + 1) * quiet`), and the ceiling
        was twelve of those windows however short they were. RED on m910q that
        day: a fake whose windows ended at 120 s printed `Still loading after 30
        minutes` and gave up at 24 minutes of wall clock saying six hours.

        The ceiling (`READY_CEILING_SECONDS`) is the outer bound on a server
        that prints for ever, and it is now wall clock rather than a count of
        windows. The last window is shortened to whatever is left of it, so the
        wait spends at most the ceiling and never more — including for a
        `timeout_s` that does not divide it (2500 bought nine whole windows and
        overshot by fifteen minutes) and for one LARGER than it, which now buys
        one window of six hours instead of one of its own full length. The
        catalogue asking for longer than the ceiling does not raise the ceiling.

        Two gaps inherited from `docker.wait_ready()`, recorded in 7.1 and still
        true: its crash-loop latch and its `fatal` search both look at the WORLD
        container only, so an auth container that loops or prints a fatal line
        is not seen. Both are conservative — slower to give up, never quicker to
        call a dead server ready.

        The fix for bug-checklist §35, driven on real hardware 2026-09-02: a
        WoW TBC server this app installed on m910q was joined from another PC
        over Tailscale, auth succeeded, the realm list arrived, and the world
        connect could not — `realmd.realmlist.address` was still
        `127.0.0.1`, so the client had been told the world server was on its
        OWN machine and hung at "Connecting" saying nothing. One
        `UPDATE realmd.realmlist SET address='100.78.24.50' WHERE id=1` later
        the same client reached a character screen. Every piece of this existed
        (`networking.realmlist_sql()`, `CatalogEntry.realmlist`,
        `platform.detect_lan_ip()`, the Networking tab) and nothing on the
        install path ever ran any of it, so EVERY server this app installed was
        unreachable from every other machine until somebody found that tab.

        Here rather than in a family, because all four shipped games have a
        `realmlist` block and all four had the bug. NOT a stage: `STAGE_NAMES`
        is pinned by equality tests in two families, a new name would be
        written into every state file in the wild, and a step that must run on
        every resume would have to be `recorded=False` anyway — which is to say
        it would be this, with a name.

        **Nothing here can fail the install, and that is the whole design.**
        By the time this runs the server is built, imported, started and has
        reported ready; the user has been promised a working server and has
        one. Five outcomes, one line each — and the first of them is a file.

        bug-checklist §41: the last four all end in the row being rewritten or
        in a reason it was not, and none of them could tell a row that says
        `127.0.0.1` because nobody set it from one that says `127.0.0.1`
        because the owner asked for it. The row cannot answer that — it is the
        same eight characters either way — so the answer is recorded intent,
        written by `networking.apply()` when the Networking tab's `loopback`
        mode was applied, and read here BEFORE anything else this method does.
        Before, and not after: on 2026-09-06 at `30671d6e` two mutations of this
        order were run on m910q from a fresh `git clone --shared` with
        `__pycache__` purged on both sides
        (`pyplan/gates/bug41-loopback-2026-09-05/mutations-round3.txt`). Reading
        the intent after `self._detected_lan_ip()` still left the row alone, and
        reading it after the `address is None` return printed
        `REALM_ADDRESS_UNKNOWN` instead of the §41 sentence on a machine with no
        LAN address — the machine this mode exists for. Both kept
        `_statements()` and `sql_calls` empty, so the two empty lists in
        `test_spine.py::test_a_loopback_the_owner_chose_is_left_alone_and_the_line_says_why`
        hold nothing here; what holds it is that test's call-counting `lan_ip`
        seam plus
        `test_spine.py::test_the_machine_this_mode_is_for_has_no_lan_address_at_all`.

        * the owner CHOSE the loopback — nothing is detected, nothing is asked,
          nothing is sent, and the line says which file says so and how to undo
          it. A server whose loopback was never chosen has no such file and
          falls through to the four below, which is §41's other half;
        * no address — `REALM_ADDRESS_UNKNOWN`, and no SQL is attempted at all.
          A guess would be worse than the default, and a refusal would be a lie
          about what happened;
        * the row is ALREADY REACHABLE — nothing is sent. Not "already equal
          to the LAN address": equality is the wrong question, and asking it
          was a real defect. `networking.apply()` exists so a user can advertise
          a PUBLIC address for internet play, and every ordinary resume of the
          installer runs this method again. Comparing against the LAN address
          overwrote that public address with a LAN one and printed "players on
          other machines can reach this server", which was the opposite of what
          had just happened (review, 2026-09-03). The question that matters is
          whether the row can be reached from another machine at all, which is
          exactly what `networking.advertisable()` already answers;
        * the UPDATE failed — said, with what the database answered, plus where
          to fix it by hand. The install stays successful;
        * it worked — said, naming the address, because the address is what the
          user has to type into their client next.

def _listing(folder: Path, *, ignoring: Collection[str] = ()) -> list[str]:
    """What is in `folder`, minus `ignoring` — or a refusal, never a bare `OSError`.

    THE ONLY PLACE THIS ENGINE DECIDES WHETHER A FOLDER IS ITS TO WRITE INTO.
    That is narrower than what this line said until 2026-09-05 — "THE ONLY
    PLACE THIS ENGINE LISTS A DIRECTORY" — which was true of no commit that
    ever carried it. `families/clientdir.py` walks a client's `Data/` in
    `_to_depth()` and `locale_dirs()`, `families/extract.py` counts what a tool
    produced in `file_count()`, and `families/sqlplan.py` lists `Updates/` in a
    second private function of this very name. Those three READ a folder
    somebody else filled and deliberately let the `OSError` out to a caller
    with a better sentence for it than this one has — `mpq_files()` says so in
    as many words, because `rglob()` answering short would reach the user as
    "too few archives" about a folder nobody could open. Rewording was the fix
    rather than routing them through here: they need `Path`s and the raw error,
    and this function exists to hand back names and a refusal.

    The narrow claim is pinned by enumeration rather than by assertion:
    `test_every_folder_listing_in_the_package_is_accounted_for` lists every
    directory listing under `yulon/` in eight spellings — `iterdir`, `scandir`,
    `listdir`, `glob`, `iglob`, `rglob`, `walk`, `fwalk`, at module level and
    inside `async def` too — with the reason each is not a write decision, so a
    new one anywhere in the app fails that audit rather than quietly making this
    paragraph false again. It read two modules until 2026-09-05, which is how a
    sentence about the whole engine went unchecked over five sixths of it; then
    three spellings under `yulon/catalog/`, which a `glob` respelling of the
    very regression it was widened for walked straight past; then six, which
    `glob.iglob` walked past the same way. Eight is a set that can be checked,
    and `test_the_listing_audit_sees_every_spelling_it_names` checks it — not a
    claim to read every spelling Python has, which is what the set's own
    docstring said both times it was wrong.

    Not every listed site is exonerated: `apply.py`'s `_require_own_clone()`
    makes THIS decision — may the module applier write into this clone dir —
    with a bare `iterdir()` and no `except` at all, so an unreadable clone dir
    reaches the user as a `PermissionError` traceback (measured, m910q
    2026-09-05). It is recorded in that map as a defect rather than a design,
    and filed; the sentence at the top of this docstring is about the INSTALL
    engine and stays true.

    The caller that made the point was `installer.cancelled_install_message()`,
    which decided with a bare `iterdir()` whether the folder the user just
    stopped an install in has leftovers — `_claim_folder()`'s question, asked
    by the copy that tells the user what `_claim_folder()` will do. Two answers
    to one question, and they could differ on exactly the folder that matters,
    the one neither can read. It comes through here now, and both answers are
    driven on one unreadable folder in
    `test_a_folder_the_copy_cannot_list_is_refused_rather_than_called_empty`.

    Four sites asked `folder.iterdir()` bare until 2026-09-02 — `_claim_folder()`, which every
    shipped game reaches through preflight and `_guard()`;
    `stage_clone_sources()`, which the three CMaNGOS games bind; and
    AzerothCore's `_clone_core()` and `_clone_modules()` — and reproduced
    through the real `install_wiring.main()` at all four, an unreadable folder
    printed a `PermissionError` traceback where the harness's own docstring
    promises the sentence written for a person. At the three stage sites
    `run()`'s `except InstallerError` could not see it either, so
    `_record_error` never ran and the state file kept `"last_error": ""`. That
    is the same shape as the `composegen.render()` blocker (`b22ab381`), and
    the same fix: translate where the call is.

    REFUSE, never assume empty. A listing that fails says nothing about what is
    in there, and the caller's next move on "empty" is a clone whose seam
    `shutil.rmtree`s a destination it does not recognise. Treating an
    unreadable folder as empty would delete a user's files on exactly the input
    where the engine knows least — the same trade `_claim_folder()` makes for a
    state file it cannot parse.

    Not exotic, either: `iterdir()` raises for a permission change, an
    unreadable mount, a drive that went away, and a stale UNC path into a WSL
    distro — the app reaches folders that way often enough that
    `Identification.UNVERIFIED` exists in the UI for it.

    `ignoring` is a single name that does not count as content, which is
    `STATE_FILE` at three of the four sites; `_clone_modules()` passes nothing,
    because a module directory holding this app's state file would be a
    leftover worth refusing over.

    Raises:
        InstallerError: the folder could not be listed. The sentence names the
            folder, carries what the OS said, and is distinct from every
            "this folder has files in it" refusal above it.
