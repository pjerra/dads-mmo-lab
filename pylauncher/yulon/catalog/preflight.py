"""Preflight for the native install engine: refuse, don't warn (roadmap 6.2).

Two halves, deliberately separated. `gather()` collects facts about THIS
machine through seams (`platform.py` for the OS, `docker.py` for the daemon);
`evaluate()` is a pure function from those facts plus the entry's floors to a
typed report. The split is what makes every threshold testable without a
daemon, and it keeps the rule the layers already have: `platform.py` knows no
games, `catalog.json` holds the numbers, and neither knows the other's half.

**The tri-state discipline is the point.** Every check answers refuse, warn,
*unchecked* or pass, and `unchecked` is never rounded to either neighbour. A
stopped Docker Desktop prints well-formed zeroes, so a check that reads a
number without confirming the engine spoke refuses a perfectly good machine
with "0 GB of RAM" (`pyplan/rust-prior-art.md` §3). An unreadable measurement
is reported as "unchecked — that is not a pass".

**Every numeric floor is inherited, none is measured by this project.** They
come from the earlier Rust launcher's incidents, are carried as data in
`catalog.json` (`install.native`), and the first live gates exist to replace
them with measurements — see `catalog.NativeInstall`.

The free-space floors in particular are still UNVERIFIED, and this module is
not where they could be changed. The 40/60 GB pair is `rust-prior-art.md` §3
verbatim, with no measurement recorded behind it; the CMaNGOS entries' 20/30
pair came from the 7.3 plan, and on a one-drive box the two halves add to the
same 40/60. What the gate boxes DID measure, on 2026-09-02, is the half a `du`
can attribute to one install: `du -sh` on a finished server folder answered
2.3 GB for `~/wow-server` and 2.8 GB for `~/vanilla-server` on yulon-ubuntu,
and 3.9 GB for `~/tbc-server` on m910q — folders named by hand during the
gates, so which game each holds is read off the name rather than off an install
record. The Docker side could not be attributed at all: both boxes hold several
installs' images and one shared build cache. So nothing here proposes a better
number, and the installs that warned at 51 GB free went on to succeed.

    Three things were wrong with the sentence this used to print, and the

    It stays a WARN because it was measured non-predictive rather than wrong:
    the Ubuntu gate (2026-08-31, defect D4) ran 16 parallel compilers against
    19.5 GB — a box this check warns about — and the AzerothCore build finished
    with nothing OOM-killed. The 2 GB-per-job figure is AzerothCore's own,
    carried in `catalog.py`, and one roomy box completing does not refute it for
    a 6 GB one, so the warning stayed and the certainty in its wording went.

    That same gate recorded the second fault: it advised "set Docker Desktop to
    8 CPUs" on a box running Docker Engine, which has no such pane and no CPU
    setting at all. The remedy is now written for the engine the user has, the
    way `_bind_remedy()` already was.

    The third is why this function now takes an entry. It read only `facts`, so
    it printed the identical CPU-derived sentence for every game; on the box
    that warned on 2026-09-02 (15 CPUs, 19.5 GB) the Vanilla entry it also
    installed compiles with `make -j2` fixed in `catalog.json`, so the "16

    Docker Engine on Linux has no such list and no such settings pane, so that
    sentence is unactionable there — and after the probe stopped being defeated

    here is no longer SELinux either. What is left is the folder: a directory on

    fuse home, a network share) the daemon cannot follow.

    over a command. It used to say "run `chcon -Rt container_file_t

    container runs `--security-opt label:disable`, so relabelling the host
    directory cannot alter what it saw. The sentence diagnosed correctly and
