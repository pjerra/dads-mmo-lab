"""Preflight for the native install engine: refuse, don't warn (roadmap 6.2).

Two halves, deliberately separated. `gather()` collects facts about THIS
machine through seams (`platform.py` for the OS, `docker.py` for the daemon);
`evaluate()` is a pure function from those facts plus the entry's floors to a
typed report. The split is what makes every threshold testable without a
daemon, and it keeps the rule the layers already have: `platform.py` knows no
games, `catalog.json` holds the numbers, and neither knows the other's half.

**The tri-state discipline is the point.** Every check answers refuse, warn,
*unchecked* or pass, and `unchecked` is never rounded to either neighbour. A
stopped Docker Desktop prints well-formed zeroes, so a check that reads a
number without confirming the engine spoke refuses a perfectly good machine
with "0 GB of RAM" (`pyplan/rust-prior-art.md` §3). An unreadable measurement
is reported as "unchecked — that is not a pass".

**Every numeric floor is inherited, none is measured by this project.** They
come from the earlier Rust launcher's incidents, are carried as data in
`catalog.json` (`install.native`), and the first live gates exist to replace
them with measurements — see `catalog.NativeInstall`.

The free-space floors in particular are still UNVERIFIED, and this module is
not where they could be changed. The 40/60 GB pair is `rust-prior-art.md` §3
verbatim, with no measurement recorded behind it; the CMaNGOS entries' 20/30
pair came from the 7.3 plan, and on a one-drive box the two halves add to the
same 40/60. What the gate boxes DID measure, on 2026-09-02, is the half a `du`
can attribute to one install: `du -sh` on a finished server folder answered
2.3 GB for `~/wow-server` and 2.8 GB for `~/vanilla-server` on yulon-ubuntu,
and 3.9 GB for `~/tbc-server` on m910q — folders named by hand during the
gates, so which game each holds is read off the name rather than off an install
record. The Docker side could not be attributed at all: both boxes hold several
installs' images and one shared build cache. So nothing here proposes a better
number, and the installs that warned at 51 GB free went on to succeed.

Three cases, and `platform_id` names only two of them. `desktop` is Windows and
macOS, where Docker Desktop is the only supported engine. `engine` is a Linux
machine, where the daemon is a service. `wsl` is a WSL distro — and it is a
PLACE, not an engine.

**`wsl` is deliberately the ambiguous one, and naming it after the place rather
than the engine is the point.** A distro's `docker` may be Docker Desktop's
through WSL integration, or a Docker Engine installed inside the distro with
`apt install docker.io`. Nothing in `Facts` separates those two, so every `wsl`
arm below either names BOTH routes or says something true of both. A `wsl` arm
that names only Docker Desktop is the T40 defect pointed at a new audience: the
first draft of this fix did exactly that on three rows, and a distro running its
own engine has no Desktop to start, no integration tick and no disk image.

What is true of both: WSL's memory and CPU count come from Windows'
`%UserProfile%\\.wslconfig` whoever runs the daemon inside, because Windows
sizes the distro. Those arms name one action and are right.

today. `platform.vm_resources()` is the only caller that parses that JSON and it
keeps `MemTotal` and `NCPU` only.

Building one was weighed and refused for this ticket. It cannot help the row
that needs it most: the dead-daemon row refuses precisely because `docker info`
did not answer, so that arm must name both routes whatever else exists. Adding
a mechanism that fixes two of the three rows would leave the file carrying two
ways of answering one question — which is the shape T40 exists to remove — and
the discriminator itself would be an unverified claim about output this project
has never captured from a Docker Desktop box.

    "did not answer" there is not that it is stopped at all but that the user is

    The Linux arm hedges its own first clause for the same class of reason. Not
    every Linux Docker is a system service: rootless Docker runs under

    2026-09-02: yulon-ubuntu carries `/var/lib/docker` and `/home` on one
    `/dev/sda2`, m910q on one `/dev/nvme0n1p3`, so this is the ordinary shape of
    a Linux test box rather than an edge case.

    The SMALLER of the two readings, not the first one. On one volume they
    should be equal; they are two `statvfs` calls at two moments, and if they
    disagree the smaller is the one that can refuse. `None` from one of them is
    a reading that was not taken, not a zero — only both missing makes the row
    unchecked.

    macOS never gets here (`evaluate()` sends it down the two-row path) because
    there the two rows are not duplicates: "Docker's disk" is the host volume
    holding a sparse VM image behind its own cap, so an ample reading there is
    `unchecked` while the same number for the server folder is a genuine pass.
    Collapsing them would quietly promote the first to the second.

    Docker Engine on Linux has no such list and no such settings pane, so that
    sentence is unactionable there — and after the probe stopped being defeated
    by SELinux confinement (`docker._probe_selinux_argv()`), a Linux failure
    here is no longer SELinux either. What is left is the folder: a directory on
    the way down that the daemon's user cannot traverse, or a mount (autofs, a
    fuse home, a network share) the daemon cannot follow.

    So while SELinux is enforcing the appendix RULES IT OUT rather than handing
    over a command. It used to say "run `chcon -Rt container_file_t
    {server_dir}`", and that was wrong twice over. The path usually does not
    exist yet — the probe walks up to the nearest *populated* ancestor precisely
    because the chosen folder is routinely absent or empty at preflight time, so

    directory`. And it could not have changed the outcome anyway: the probe
    container runs `--security-opt label:disable`, so relabelling the host
    directory cannot alter what it saw. The sentence diagnosed correctly and
    then offered a remedy for a different diagnosis. A user on an enforcing box
    needs to be told to stop looking there, and where to look instead.

    `is True`, not truthiness, for the reason the whole diff spells the three
    answers out: `None` is "nobody could ask". It happens to read the same here
