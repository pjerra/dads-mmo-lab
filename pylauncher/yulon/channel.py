"""One command in, one typed answer out (Phase 8.2a).

The seam every feature above this calls. It holds no command text — that is
`commands.py` — and no UI. What it owns is three things:

**The three-outcome answer.** `yes` is a command the server ran and reported as
succeeding. `no` is one it ran and refused. `unknown` is everything else, and it
is not a failure of the command: it is the absence of an answer about it. The
spike that measured a published port against a listener on the container's own
loopback found exactly these three on the wire — refused, silent, answering —
so the type is the shape the transport already has.

**A write is never retried.** A timeout carries `indeterminate=True` and stops
there. The command may have run: the listener queues onto the world thread and
blocks until it finishes (`ACSoap.cpp:120-130`), so a client giving up says
nothing about whether the server did. A retry that then succeeded would report
"done" for a command that ran twice — two accounts, two mails, two of whatever
it was.

**One lock per install.** The SOAP listener runs on the single world thread, so
two commands in flight are two things queued behind each other at best. The
prior art serialises for the same reason and says so
(`launcher/src-tauri/src/lib.rs:117-123`), noting that even the bash CLI took a
`~/.dml/soap.lock` file lock. Per install rather than global, because this app
can hold two servers open and they are two world threads.

And when it could not ask, it says **why** — read from container state at that
moment rather than guessed, so the sentence tells the user what to do next.

    Tortoise's mangosd links neither gsoap nor `RASocket` -- its complete source

    port to publish and no account to authenticate. What it has is the console
    the Console tab already types at, live-gated against a real worldserver on
    2026-08-23, and this wraps it in the one method every feature module is
    handed.

    **The distinction this class exists for** is what a window with no prompt in
    it means. `ConsoleReply.prompted` is False when nothing was delimited, and
    the transport cannot tell why: `docker attach` failing before it reached a
    console looks exactly like a worldserver that is up and still loading its
    maps. Either way the command may have been typed and may have run. So that
    is `unknown` carrying `indeterminate` -- "I could not ask" -- and never
    `no`, which would invite a caller to do it again.

    A `ConsoleError` is the opposite half and is deliberately NOT indeterminate:
    it is raised before anything is typed, so the command certainly did not run.

    Nothing here is ever `denied`. There is no credential on this transport to
    reject, and a feature keying off that flag must not read "no prompt" as "your
