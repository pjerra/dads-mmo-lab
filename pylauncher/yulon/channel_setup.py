"""The app's own SOAP account: mint it, prove it, then keep it (Phase 8.2a).

Pure and seam-injected, so the whole decision tree is testable with no server
and no database. What is impure — creating the row, writing the credential file,
enabling the listener — is layered on top and hands its answers back in here.

## Everything below was learned once already

`rust-main:crates/dml-wow/src/soap_autosetup.rs` has been through this, and its
three hard-won rules are kept with their reasons:

**A create that succeeded followed by a verify that failed must not reopen the
latch.** Otherwise the next poll creates a SECOND account and the one after that
a third — one row per tick into the user's auth database, forever. That is why
this is a state machine and not a function: `Pending` carries the credential
forward and says re-verify, never re-create. Design C's write ledger flagged the
same file as the hazard (`soap_autosetup.rs:116-120`) and named this as the
defence.

**Sixteen characters is a ceiling, not a preference.** AzerothCore validates
`{4,16}` before it writes anything, so a "stronger" 32-character password is
refused on every fresh install — at the one moment the user has nothing to
retype.

**Rejection sampling, not `byte % 70`.** 256 is not a multiple of the alphabet's
70 symbols (`256 = 3*70 + 46`), so plain modulo hands the first 46 symbols a
fourth chance the other 24 never get. The bias is invisible in any output a
person would look at, which is exactly why it belongs in code rather than in a
review.

## What this module adds to that

The account's **name is derived from the install id**, so two installs of one
game on one machine get different accounts and the same install always gets the
same one. That is what makes "create" idempotent: a second run finds the row it
made last time instead of writing another.

And only `Verified` can produce credentials. The architecture's rule for this
module — never persist before a round trip has answered — is expressed in the
types rather than in a comment: the earlier states have no such method, so a
caller cannot write a credential file it has not proved.
