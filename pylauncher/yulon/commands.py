"""The text a command becomes, and the arguments it refuses (Phase 8.2a).

Pure: this module sends nothing, holds no lock and knows no container. It turns
a template and some arguments into one line, and refuses arguments the server
would refuse — so nothing reaches the wire that cannot succeed.

## The leading dot lives here, once

The console and SOAP parser strips a leading `.` or `!` before it looks anything
up (`azerothcore.md:161-176`, `if (str[0] == '.' || str[0] == '!')`), while the
in-game handler *requires* one (`Chat.cpp:255-256`). So on this route the dot is
a matter of taste — and the prior art shipped both tastes: its `gm_level_cmd`
emits `.character level {player} {level}` with a dot and its `gm_at_login_cmd`
emits `character {flag} {player}` without, both pinned by their own tests, with
no comment explaining the asymmetry (`hypeer.md:1369-1374`).

Yu'lon's templates therefore carry no dot, and this module is the one place that
decides. A template that grows one anyway still produces the same line, because
`line()` strips it.

## The validators are the server's, not this app's

The charsets and lengths come from the bash oracle by way of the Rust port
(`soap_cmds.rs:24-40`, from `cli/src/90-main.sh:116-138`). They are allow-lists,
which is what stops an argument smuggling a second command into a line: a space
or a semicolon is simply not in the set.

    `realms` is required and not defaulted, because the two cores disagree and
    neither disagreement fails loudly.

    AzerothCore keeps the level in `account_access`, which has a `RealmID`
    column, so its command takes a realm and `-1` means every one of them. SOAP
    reads that table with no realm filter, so a row pinned to a single realm id
    would not be seen on this path; the prior art passes `-1` for the same
    reason (`soap_cmds.rs:95`).

    The CMaNGOS handler takes no such argument. It is
    `account set gmlevel <account> <level>`, and it writes
    `UPDATE account SET gmlevel = '%i' WHERE id = '%u'` against the account row
    (`Level3.cpp:1080-1128`, read on the TBC install 2026-09-07). There is no
    realm to name because there is no table with realms in it.

    The caller knows which it is from a fact its own box already measured:
    `entry.accounts.level.table` is null exactly where the level is a column.

    `highest` is required for the same reason and comes from the same block.
    Three of these trees stop at 3 and the tortoise fork accepts 4, because its
    check grants at the caller's own level rather than strictly below it
    (measured live, 2026-09-07: `4` was accepted and `5` answered "Incorrect
    values."). A number in this file would refuse a level the server accepts,
