"""Ending a container this app started under a name of its own, after a Stop (T240, T303).

On Docker Desktop a Stop that ends the docker CLI does not end the container it
was attached to: a clone's container went on cloning as an orphan (T240), and an
extraction tool's went on writing into the server's `data/` (T303). So both
name their containers and end them here by that name: `docker rm -f`, which
kills and removes in one command.

The clone (`git.py`) and the extraction tools (`docker.run_container()`) share
this rather than each spelling it, because the second look below is the part a
copy would lose.

**Created first, then started (T321).** Both make their container with
`create()` -- `docker create --rm --name <name>`, synchronous, which no Stop
ends -- and then attach to it with a streamed `docker start -a <name>`, whose
exit code is the container's. So by the time anything can be stopped, the name
exists: a Stop during the create is seen once the create returns, and one
during the start ends a container known to be there, where "gone" means gone.
Until T321 one `docker run` both created and started it, and a Stop that ended
that CLI mid-create left the daemon free to create the container a moment
after `rm -f` had found nothing; the second look below is kept now only for a
create that did not answer in time and was ended by its timeout.
