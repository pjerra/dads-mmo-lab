"""Base controller every per-game `controller_<acronym>/` package subclasses.

This is the one place the *object-shaped* shared surface lives (roadmap Phase
1.4; style-guide §4). The behavior itself — compose up/down, `docker ps`
parsing, health polling, the port scan — stays in the module-level functions
of `yulon.docker`; this class only composes a `ContainerSpec` with a server
directory and layers the single-instance policy from README §12 on top of
`start()`. A per-game subclass supplies its spec and inherits everything else
with zero reimplementation.

Genuine "is-a" (style-guide §2): a WotLK controller *is a* controller. What it
holds — the spec, the server dir — is composed, not inherited.

Deliberately **not** here: anything manifest-driven. Module/mod knowledge is
Phase 2.3's `modules.py`, layered on later, never stubbed in this class.

        An earlier version of this docstring said removing them would put the
        next start "back on `compose up -d` and re-running the one-shot database
        import". That has not been true since `start_staged()` began naming its
        three services explicitly: it selects `db auth world` with `--no-deps`,
        so compose cannot reach `ac-db-import` even when the containers are
        gone. Keeping them is now a matter of speed, not of safety, and saying
        otherwise made the safe action look dangerous (2026-08-23). Teardown
