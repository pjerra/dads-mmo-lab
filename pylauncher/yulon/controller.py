"""Base controller every per-game `controller_<acronym>/` package subclasses.

This is the one place the *object-shaped* shared surface lives (roadmap Phase
1.4; style-guide §4). The behavior itself — compose up/down, `docker ps`
parsing, health polling, the port scan — stays in the module-level functions
of `yulon.docker`; this class only composes a `ContainerSpec` with a server
directory and layers the single-instance policy from README §12 on top of
`start()`. A per-game subclass supplies its spec and inherits everything else
with zero reimplementation.

Genuine "is-a" (style-guide §2): a WotLK controller *is a* controller. What it
holds — the spec, the server dir — is composed, not inherited.

Deliberately **not** here: anything manifest-driven. Module/mod knowledge is
Phase 2.3's `modules.py`, layered on later, never stubbed in this class.
