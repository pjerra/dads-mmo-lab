"""Game accounts for WoW TBC: the CMaNGOS binding of the shared SRP6 writer.

No crypto is written here. `controller_wow_wotlk/accounts.py` already carries
all three account shapes this app knows — AzerothCore's binary `salt`/`verifier`
with the level in `account_access`, tortoise's `sha_pass_hash` with the level in
`account.rank`, and CMaNGOS's `mangos_srp6`: the same modulus, generator and
`H(s || H(U:P))` as AzerothCore, stored as uppercase big-endian hex in `v`/`s`
with the level in `account.gmlevel`. That third shape was solved from rows the
servers themselves shipped — the seeded ADMINISTRATOR and PLAYER accounts read
off a live TBC and a live Vanilla server on 2026-08-26, byte-identical on both
— and `tests/test_accounts.py` pins them. Duplicating any of it here would be a
second copy of an algorithm whose whole value is that it matches a measurement.

What this module supplies is the two facts that module takes as arguments:

* the scheme, read from `accounts.scheme` in the entry rather than spelled here
  — a wrong scheme does not fail, it writes a row that looks perfect and can
  never log in;
* the seam: `DockerSql` over `tbc-db` with THIS core's schema names, so a
  statement goes to `realmd` and not to `acore_auth` (`Unknown database
  'acore_auth'` on every CMaNGOS install was a real report, 2026-08-26).

`expansion` is deliberately absent from the insert, and that is right for this
core rather than an omission: the installer's SQL plan ends with an "expansion
unlock" phase that sets `realmd.account.expansion` to a column default of 1 and
updates every existing row (`catalog.json`), so an account created afterwards
gets TBC without this app naming a number the schema already carries.

UNVERIFIED, and the reason it is named here rather than papered over: the
shared `create_account()` follows its insert with AzerothCore's
`realmcharacters` seeding statement on every scheme. Whether CMaNGOS's `realmd`
has that table has NOT been checked against a TBC schema by this project. If it
does not, account creation on this game raises `AccountError` naming the failed
statement — a loud failure, not a silent one — and the fix belongs in the shared
module, not in a fork of it here.

    to obtain the one thing it needs. Vanilla and Tortoise both had it; TBC's
