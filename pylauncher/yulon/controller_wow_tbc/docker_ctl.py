"""Docker lifecycle for the WoW TBC server, and this package's one source of game facts.

The shared behavior (`start`/`stop`/`status`/`health`/polling/`port_conflicts`)
lives in `yulon.docker` and is re-exported below, exactly as
`controller_wow_wotlk/docker_ctl.py` re-exports it. What differs from that file
is where the per-game facts come from: WotLK's spells its three container names
as literals, and this one reads them — with the schema names, the database
client, the ready markers and the console prompt — out of the `wow-tbc` entry
in `catalog.json`.

That is not tidiness. `catalog.json` already carries every one of those values
because `composegen` writes the compose file from them, so a name retyped here
is a second source of truth that can drift from the file that actually creates
the container. The generated stack names its services after its containers
(`shared/cmangos/base.yml.tmpl`), so `ContainerSpec.services` stays empty and
`docker compose up -d --no-deps <db>` keeps working unchanged.

**No `repair_import` is exported, and that is the entry speaking.** AzerothCore
imports its databases from a one-shot compose service (`ac-db-import`) which
`docker.repair_import()` can re-run; the CMaNGOS stack has no such service —
its import is a stage of the installer, streaming SQL files into the database
client — so the entry's `containers` block names no `db_import` and
`ContainerSpec.import_service` is empty. `docker.repair_import()` refuses on
exactly that fact, before it touches anything, so exporting it here would only
put a name in front of a refusal.
