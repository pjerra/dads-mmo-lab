"""Database backup and restore for a TBC install: the shared engine, this game's names.

`controller_wow_wotlk/maintenance.py` is already game-agnostic where it counts.
It asks the server which schemas it has rather than assuming a list, it verifies
every dump before a file wears a backup's name, and it takes the container spec
and the core schema names as arguments. All of that is imported, not copied.

What this module supplies is those arguments, and one of them closes a reported
bug rather than merely tidying: `CORE_DATABASES` defaults to AzerothCore's
`acore_auth, acore_characters, acore_world`, and a backup taken with that
default on a CMaNGOS install reported "expected but absent: acore_auth,
acore_characters, acore_world" on a dump that had taken everything the server
had (Discord report, 2026-08-26). The wrappers below bind
`entry.core_databases()` and this game's `ContainerSpec` so a caller cannot
reach the engine without them.

**The dump client.** `DockerMysql` resolves `mysql`/`mysqldump` by asking the
container which name it answers to, which lands on `mariadb`/`mariadb-dump` for
the `mariadb:11` image this entry names — and `mariadb:11` ships neither of the
`mysql*` symlinks, so the answer matters. That resolution is a probe, not data,
so `mysql_for()` now also hands it `docker_ctl.DB_CLIENT` and the probe still
wins where it can answer.

The UNVERIFIED note that stood here asked whether the probe's fallback (the
first candidate) is ever reached on this image. It no longer decides anything:
the fallback used to be `mysql` and is now the declared `mariadb`, so the two
paths agree and the question is closed by construction rather than by
measurement (review, 2026-09-03).

`logs` is not among them, and that is the entry's answer rather than an
