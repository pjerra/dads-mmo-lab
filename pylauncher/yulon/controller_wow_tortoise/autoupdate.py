"""This fork's own database auto-updater, and the guard that keeps a module install off it.

Checklist 2504 gives 8.7d one clause no sibling box has: *nothing may run this
fork's own database auto-update path while the world is up*. This module is
that clause. Everything below was measured on m910q, 2026-09-08, against this
install's own source at `~/tortoise-server/src/tortoise-wow` (`3a8472e`) and its
own `etc/mangosd.conf` — per-tree facts, measured per tree.

**What the path is.** `World::SetInitialWorldSettings()` calls
`sAutoUpdater.ProcessUpdates()` and, on a false answer, logs
`DB AutoUpdater FAILED, cancelling server.` and calls `exit(1)`
(`src/game/World.cpp:1987-1994`). So on this fork the updater IS the
worldserver, running at startup, and **one bad migration cancels the whole
world**. That is the difference from AzerothCore, where the same idea is
`ac-db-import`, a separate one-shot container that can fail on its own without
taking a world down. `SqlStep.applied_by="db-import"` therefore means something
much more dangerous here than the word suggests.

**What arms it.**

* `Database.AutoUpdate.Enabled` — read as
  `sConfig.GetBoolDefault("Database.AutoUpdate.Enabled", true)`
  (`src/shared/Database/AutoUpdater.cpp:493`). **An absent key means ENABLED.**
  A reader that treated "not written down" as "off" would wave through the exact
  configuration every stock install runs.
* `Database.AutoUpdate.Path`, plus `AuthUpdateName`, `CharUpdateName` and
  `WorldUpdateName` — the three folders under it. This fork's shipped values are
  `auth`/`character`/`world`; MaNGOS's compiled defaults are `Logon`/`Char`/
  `World` (`AutoUpdater.cpp:499-501`), and inheriting those would look in three
  directories that do not exist and report a confident zero.
* The files themselves: every `*.sql` directly inside a folder, not recursively
  (`directory_iterator`, `AutoUpdater.cpp:102-106`).
* The ledger: a `migrations` table **in each target database**, keyed
  `<module>:<sha1 of the file bytes>` (`AutoUpdater.cpp:83-86`, `:114-127`,
  `:443`). Rows whose file is gone are old migrations and are harmless; files
  whose hash has no row are what would run at the next start.

That subtraction is computable from outside the server, which is what makes a
guard possible at all: `arming_from()` does exactly what `ProcessTargetUpdates`
does, without starting anything.

**Why this is not theoretical.** Rebuilding this fork onto its own head on
2026-09-07 crash-looped the worldserver twice on precisely this path —
`ALTER TABLE ai_playerbot_random_bots DROP INDEX idx_owner_bot_event` against an
index that was already gone (`[1091]`), then `[1062] Duplicate entry '51818-0'`
out of 173 outstanding world migrations. The owner's answer is recorded in
`pyplan/phase8-owner-answers-2026-09-08.md` §1. A module install is what asks
for the restart that re-enters it, so the guard belongs on the install path.

**Three answers, never two.** `Arming.armed` is `True`, `False` or `None`, and
`None` — "could not read" — refuses rather than passing. `migrations` genuinely
may not exist yet (the updater `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`es it on its first
run, `AutoUpdater.cpp:135`), so "no such table" is a real answer this reader
gets, and answering it with "nothing outstanding" would be the same defect
`PendingSql` and `Ownership` were each given a third answer for.
