"""The Bots tab's "Bot dashboard" switch for a Tortoise install: the Docker half (T127).

`yulon.catalog.bot_dashboard` owns what the switch writes into the install's two
files; this module builds the image, starts and removes the container, and
restarts the world, and everything it does runs off the GUI thread as a line
source for the tab's log panel.

**On**, in this order, and each step is where it is for a reason:

1. the refusals, before anything is written: no dashboard in this module's
   checkout, a compose file this app did not write, a mixed SELinux label;
2. the image, built from `tools/observability` in the module checkout the
   install already cloned. First because it is the slow step (a Go build, a
   few minutes the first time) and the one most likely to fail -- a failure
   here has changed nothing;
3. `.env` gets this install's session secret if it has none;
4. the conf is backed up once (`.before-dashboard`, `copy2`, so the mode goes
   with it) and the three keys are written, keeping the file's mode;
5. the service block goes into `docker-compose.yml`;
6. the container is started, BEFORE the world restarts: the module resolves the
   service name once, when it loads;
7. the world is restarted if it was running, so it reads the conf.

A failure in 4-6 puts the conf and the compose file back and removes the
container, so the switch never ends half on.

**Off** removes the container (while the block still names it), takes the block
out, puts the three keys back to what the backup says and removes the image. The
world keeps sending to an address nobody listens on until it restarts, which is
harmless; the tab offers the restart.

**After an update** the image is rebuilt from the module the update moved
(`after_update()`). If that rebuild fails after the module moved, the old
container is removed rather than left running: its daemon speaks the old
module's datagram protocol and nothing on either side says so (T162, measured
on TortoiseBots 632e1b63 -> ad9d71fb, protocol 4 -> 5: the daemon never reads
the datagram's `v`, and the module only sends). The switch stays On -- the
block and the three keys are the player's choice -- and `files.owe_rebuild()`
records the debt (the server folder, else Yu'lon's config dir, else memory),
which the Bots tab shows beside a "Rebuild the bot dashboard" press and the
server's Start honours. A container that will not go, or whose state cannot be
read back, is recorded as possibly still running, and the tab says so.
