"""The per-game Docker surface for Tortoise: the container spec, and what "ready" means here.

The shared behaviour (`start`/`stop`/`status`/`health`/polling/`port_conflicts`)
lives in `yulon.docker` and is not re-exported here. `controller_wow_wotlk.docker_ctl`
does re-export it, one alias per operation; nothing in the app imports those
aliases (the app drives the `Controller` object, and the only name any caller
outside that package reads is `SPEC`), so nine aliases here would be nine names
to keep in step with no reader to notice when they drift.

Two things genuinely belong to this game and are here:

* `SPEC`, built from the entry rather than written out. Its `import_service` is
  empty, because `containers.db_import` is null for this entry — this core has
  no one-shot import job to re-run, so `docker.repair_import()` refuses it by
  construction and this package exposes no repair action (see `repair.py`).
* `ready_spec()`, because "the server is up" is a different sentence on a
  mangosd than on an AzerothCore worldserver, and the base controller's is the
  latter.

    """This game's `ReadySpec`: the entry's markers, filled and made regexes.

    `docker.azerothcore_ready()` is the shape this replaces, and the two differ
    in every field. Its world marker is the literal `ready...`; a mangosd prints
    nothing of the kind, so a Tortoise server waited on with it is reported as
    never coming up. Its auth marker is `<host>:<port>` in the authserver log;
    this entry declares `auth: null`, meaning the realmd log is not waited on at
    all, and inventing a line for it would fail an install that is fine. It also
    has no `fatal` marker, which this game does: a worldserver that says its map
    files are missing is never going to be ready, and `wait_ready()` ends at once
    rather than polling out the timeout.

    `kwargs` forwards `timeout`/`interval` the way `azerothcore_ready()` does,
    and an explicit `timeout` wins over the entry's `timeout_s`; with neither,
    the entry's is used, which is the point of it being data. Markers other than
    the entry's go through `ready_spec_from()`, which this is a binding of.

    Filling and escaping mirror what the install spine does at the end of an
    install (`native.StagedInstaller._ready_spec`), because they are the same
    markers read at a different moment. Two things differ and neither can be
    borrowed: that method fills `REALM_HOST` with the installer's fixed
    loopback address while this one fills it with the host the caller is
    watching for, and it raises `InstallerError`, which is the vocabulary of an
    install and not of a running server.

    Raises:
        TypeError: a keyword other than `timeout`/`interval`, as
            `azerothcore_ready()` refuses them — `restart_loop` is an int and
            comes from the entry, and anything else is a typo.
        ReadyMarkerError: a marker left a `{{TOKEN}}` unfilled, or is declared
            `regex: true` and does not compile. Raised before anything is
            polled, so a typo in a data file is never a crash in the middle of
            a wait.
