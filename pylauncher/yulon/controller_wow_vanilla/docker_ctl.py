"""Docker lifecycle for the Vanilla server: this game's `ContainerSpec` and its readiness.

The shared behaviour (`start`/`stop`/`status`/`health`/polling/
`port_conflicts`) lives in `yulon.docker` and is re-exported below unchanged,
exactly as `controller_wow_wotlk/docker_ctl.py` does it. Two things are this
game's own and are the reason this module is not that one:

**The spec comes from the catalog, not from literals.** `SPEC` is
`entry().container_spec()`, so the container names (`vanilla-db`,
`vanilla-realmd`, `vanilla-mangosd`) and the published ports are the same
values `composegen` generated the compose file from. Its `import_service` is
empty, because the entry names no `db_import` service — a CMaNGOS install has
no one-shot importer.

**`repair_import` is deliberately NOT re-exported.** `docker.repair_import()`
refuses outright without an `import_service`, and offering the name here would
promise a repair this game cannot perform. What replaces it is in `repair.py`.

**Readiness is the entry's marker, not AzerothCore's.** `docker.wait_ready()`
searches the current run's log with `re.search`, and a CMaNGOS worldserver
never prints `ready...`. This entry names `Avg Diff:` and leaves `ready.auth`
null, so `ready_spec()` waits on the world log only. Handing this game
`docker.azerothcore_ready()` would produce a wait that can only ever time out
— except that `ready...` unescaped also matches `alREADY UP-to-date`, so it
would sometimes "succeed" against a still-loading server instead.

here that names a client to `sqlplan` passes this value.

`apply.DockerSql` and `maintenance.DockerMysql` resolve the same question a
different way — `apply.mysql_client()` asks the container `command -v` and
caches the answer — so they need no argument from here. The two answers agree
for a healthy install; this one is what the entry DECLARES, and that one is
what the container actually has.

    The rule applied to each marker is the spine's: fill `{{REALM_HOST}}` and
    `{{WORLD_PORT}}`, then `re.escape` the result unless the block says
    `regex: true`. That rule is written down twice now — here and in
    `catalog/families/../native.py`'s `StagedInstaller._ready_spec()`, which is
    a private method needing a `StageContext` this post-install path does not
    have. Both sites read the SAME `ReadyMarkers` object, so a marker cannot
    mean one thing to the installer and another to the controller; what could
    still drift is the escaping, and that is what
    `test_controller_wow_vanilla.py` pins against the entry's own text.

    Escaping matters here for the same reason it does there: `Avg Diff:` has no
    metacharacter today, and the first marker that gains a `.` would silently
    become a wildcard.

    Args:
        realm_host: what `{{REALM_HOST}}` becomes. This entry's markers name no
            token, so it changes nothing for `wow-vanilla`; it is accepted so a
            catalog edit that adds one does not need this function edited too.
        kwargs: `timeout` and `interval`, forwarded from a caller that has its
            own. Only those two — `restart_loop` is an int and anything else is
            a typo, so both are refused rather than silently dropped, the same
            guard `docker.azerothcore_ready()` carries.

            function cannot fill. Named here, where `catalog.json` is still the
