"""Database backup and restore for a Vanilla install: the shared machinery, this game's names.

Nothing about dumping, verifying, planning or restoring is game-specific, and
none of it is repeated here. `controller_wow_wotlk/maintenance.py` owns the
whole of it — the `.partial`-then-rename rule, `verify_dump()`'s three checks,
the plan/token/re-census restore, the in-flight marker and the carry-forward of
an earlier interrupted restore — and every per-game fact already reaches it as
an argument (`spec=`, `core_databases=`).

Two of those arguments are what this module exists to supply:

* **`spec`** — this install's containers. The refusals that keep a restore from
  running under a live worldserver are by container NAME, so a WotLK spec would
  ask whether `ac-worldserver` is up and cheerfully restore over a running
  `vanilla-mangosd`.
* **`core_databases`** — `realmd`, `characters`, `mangos`. The module-level
  default is AzerothCore's, and it is not a cosmetic difference: a CMaNGOS
  install reported "expected but absent: acore_auth, acore_characters,
  acore_world" on every successful backup, on a dump that had taken everything
  it had (Discord report, 2026-08-26). The alarm is only worth having if it
  names schemas this install could plausibly have.

The database CLIENT is the third CMaNGOS difference, and it takes BOTH
answers. `DockerMysql` resolves it through `apply.mysql_client()`, which asks
the container `command -v mysqldump || command -v mariadb-dump` and caches what
it says; that is what makes a dump work against `mariadb:11`, which ships
neither `mysql` nor `mysqldump`. `mysql_for()` also passes
`docker_ctl.DB_CLIENT`, what the entry DECLARES — which changes nothing while
the container can be asked, and decides it when it cannot. This said "needs no
argument" until 2026-09-03, on the strength of the probe alone; the unbound
fallback was `mysql`, so the one path that was left to a guess guessed the
AzerothCore answer on a MariaDB server (review).

`verify_dump()`'s banner check already admits MariaDB's sandbox directive
(`/*M!999999\\- enable the sandbox mode */`), measured on a live Tortoise server
in 2026-08-28 — which is the same client family this game runs, and the reason
a backup taken here identifies itself as a dump at all.
