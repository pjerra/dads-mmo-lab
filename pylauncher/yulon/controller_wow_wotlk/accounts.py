"""Create AzerothCore game accounts by writing the SRP6 registration row directly.

The GM console (`console.py`) cannot do this everywhere: `docker attach` refuses
a stdin that is not a TTY, so `send_command()` raises before it builds its argv
on any host where `runner.pty_supported()` is false — Windows. SOAP cannot do it
either, because SOAP authenticates against an account that must already exist,
so it can never create the first one. Writing the row is therefore the only
account path that works on all three platforms, and the only one at all for the
very first account (roadmap 6.5 item 4, `pyplan/phase6-decisions.md`).

Where the algorithm comes from
------------------------------
Read out of AzerothCore's own sources on the checkout at
`/home/pk/wow-server-playerbots` (rev `9fb906bb7296+`, Playerbot branch), not
from a blog post:

* `src/common/Cryptography/Authentication/SRP6.{h,cpp}` — `g = {7}`,
  `N = HexStrToByteArray<32>("894B…9BB7", reverse=true)`, `SALT_LENGTH = 32`,
  and `CalculateVerifier()`: `v = g ^ H(s || H(u || ':' || p)) mod N`.
* `src/common/Cryptography/BigNumber.{h,cpp}` — the endianness. Constructing a
  `BigNumber` from a byte array defaults to `littleEndian = true`
  (`BN_lebin2bn`), so the 20-byte SHA1 digest is read as a LITTLE-endian
  integer; `ToByteArray<32>()` likewise defaults to little-endian and goes
  through `BN_bn2lebinpad`, so the verifier is little-endian and zero-padded to
  exactly 32 bytes.
* `src/server/game/Accounts/AccountMgr.cpp` — `CreateAccount()` folds BOTH the
  username and the password before hashing, and treats an existing name as a
  distinct result (`AOR_NAME_ALREADY_EXIST`), not as a failure.
* `src/common/Utilities/Util.h` — the fold is `Utf8ToUpperOnlyLatin`, which is
  `isBasicLatinCharacter(c) ? wcharToUpper(c) : c`, and `isBasicLatinCharacter`
  is ASCII `a-z`/`A-Z` **only**. This is why `fold()` below is hand-written
  instead of `str.upper()`: Python would also uppercase `é`, `ß` and Cyrillic,
  which AzerothCore leaves alone, and the resulting row would look perfectly
  well-formed while never authenticating.
* `src/server/database/Database/Implementation/LoginDatabase.cpp` — the exact
  statements this module reproduces (`LOGIN_INS_ACCOUNT`,
  `LOGIN_INS_REALM_CHARACTERS_INIT`, `LOGIN_INS_ACCOUNT_ACCESS`).

What it was checked against
---------------------------
Two accounts were created **by the worldserver itself** over its console on the
Ubuntu test box on 2026-08-23, and their server-written `salt`/`verifier` read
back out of `acore_auth.account`. `verifier_for()` reproduces both from those
salts, byte for byte:

    YULONSRP6  / "Passw0rd!Mix"
      salt     D45E643F99E8702459718992BC99F982231CDAC45E3E98DD7C59BD8A8DECDB7E
      verifier A8CCB6136F23637034C3646EF4C9B3DB4D236B31E05A8A90F72692256821AB23
    YULONSRP6U / "Café1234"
      salt     5A70358B13B43BEA137CD6E00A1209A3A80B0245582007DBA1AEEC4E9CEBF727
      verifier 9079D024812206F3801D5E4B26CA5917C75EDB32413BA84DD07FAD1B5AD2FC18

The second vector is the one that earns its keep: with `str.upper()` in place of
`fold()` it comes out `78719A8A…`, and with the digest read big-endian
`F370412D…` — both wrong, both indistinguishable from correct by inspection.
Both accounts were deleted afterwards. `tests/test_accounts.py` pins the pair.

Passwords
---------
Nothing here ever writes a password anywhere it could be read back: not into
argv (the statement goes to `DockerSql` over stdin, and the DB password reaches
`mysql` through `MYSQL_PWD`), not into a log record, not into an exception
message, and not into any dataclass this module returns. Only the derived salt
and verifier reach the SQL text, and neither can be turned back into the
password.

    Reproduces what `AccountMgr::CreateAccount()` does, in the same order: the
    `account` row, then `realmcharacters` for every realm that has no counter
    for it yet. An `account_access` row is written only when `gm_level` is
    above what the account already holds.

    **Every call drives the account to the same end state, so repeating a call
    that died half way finishes it.** There is no transaction to lean on: every
    statement is its own `docker exec`, so the `account` row is committed before
    the two after it can even start. Until 2026-08-23 this function returned
    early the moment the name existed, which meant a call interrupted after that
    first commit left an account whose GM grant NO later call could ever make —
    every retry reported "already exists" and wrote nothing (review,
    2026-08-23). The steps after the account row therefore run on every path,
    not only the one that inserted it: `realmcharacters` is idempotent as
    AzerothCore wrote it, and the GM grant is skipped when the account is
    already at the level.

    An account that exists keeps its credentials — salt and verifier are never
    rewritten, so a second call with a different password does not lock the
    owner out — and its GM level is only ever raised. `gm_level` means "at
    least this", so the default cannot demote an administrator and a caller
    asking for 1 cannot strip a 3.

    **`gm_level` defaults to 0 — no `account_access` row at all.** The guide
    pairs `account create` with `account set gmlevel <name> 3 -1`, but that is
    the pairing for the *administrator's own* account, and `account_access` was
    empty after both server-written accounts in this module's docstring: the
    server's own `account create` grants nothing. Defaulting to 3 would make
    every account a full administrator, so the second family member to make a
    character could delete the realm. The bootstrap admin passes `gm_level=3`
    explicitly — which now works even when the console already made that
    account, and did not before.

    Returns:
        `AccountResult`. `created` is True only when THIS call wrote the
        `account` row; False means the name was already taken (by an earlier
        call, by the console, or by whoever won a race with us) and its
        password was left alone. `gm_level` is the level the account holds on
        return — the higher of what was asked for and what it already had. A
        genuine failure never returns.

    Raises:
        AccountError: the username or password is unusable, `gm_level` is out
            of range, or a statement failed. The seam's own `ApplyError` (no
            Docker, MySQL refused the statement, the connection dropped) is
            translated here rather than left to escape, so this is the only
