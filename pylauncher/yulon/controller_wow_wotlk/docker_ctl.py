"""Docker lifecycle for the WotLK server.

This is the per-game surface only — the shared behavior (`start`/`stop`/
`status`/`health`/polling/`port_conflicts`) lives in `yulon.docker` (DRY,
style-guide §4). What belongs *here* is exclusively the WotLK-specific
`ContainerSpec`: the three AzerothCore container names (mirroring
`dml-start.sh` constants) and the published ports shared by all v1 WoW servers.

This package spells its container names as literals (see the TBC module's

fact that had to come from data. `maintenance.DockerMysql` needs it for the
case where the container cannot be asked what client it has: the unbound
fallback is `mysql`, which is RIGHT for AzerothCore and wrong for all three
CMaNGOS games, and a value that is only ever correct by luck is the kind that
survives being copied to a game where it is wrong.
