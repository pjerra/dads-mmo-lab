"""Database backup and restore for a WotLK install (checklist 6.5, "Maintenance").

The behaviour to match is `archive/guides/wow-wotlk/WoW-WotLK-CONTROLS-1.md`
§"Backing Up Your Characters", not its shell. Four things in the guide's
commands are wrong for a program to reproduce and are deliberately not
reproduced:

* `-ppassword` puts the database root password in argv, which every local
  process can read. `apply.mysql_env()` is the one place this codebase decides
  how a password is handed to a MySQL client, and it uses `MYSQL_PWD`.
* `> ~/wow-backup-$(date).sql` is created and truncated by the shell *before*
  mysqldump runs, so a dump that fails still leaves a file with a backup's
  name. Here every dump is written to a `.partial` and only renamed once it
  has been checked, so a file with a backup's name has always passed
  `verify_dump()`.
* the databases are hardcoded to three. An install with playerbots or ALE has
  more, and `--databases acore_playerbots` against a server without it fails
  the whole dump. What exists is asked for, per install — see `backup()`.
* restore is a one-liner with a warning printed above it. A warning is not a
  mechanism; see "Restore" below.

Scope, stated rather than implied:

**There is no `clear_cache()`, and this is why.** The placeholder that used to
live here said "clear worldserver cache". No such thing exists to clear:
AzerothCore's worldserver holds no on-disk cache — world data is read out of
`acore_world` at startup and refreshed with the console's `.reload` commands or
a restart, both of which are lifecycle, not maintenance. `CONTROLS-1.md`
contains the word "cache" zero times. The two things the WotLK tooling really
does call a cache belong to other layers:

1. the **client's** `Cache/WDB/<locale>/itemcache.wdb`, which every connected
   player must delete themselves after an item-template change. It lives in the
   user's WoW client folder, on the player's own machine, and `wow-manage.sh`
   only ever *reminds* the user about it (four separate sites do). It is not a
   server action, so there is nothing here to call. `CLIENT_CACHE_NOTE` is the
   sentence to show instead of offering a button that cannot work.
2. **Docker's build cache** — `docker builder prune`, the CMake build volume,
   unused images (`wow-manage.sh`'s `cleanup_docker`). That is disk-space and
   rebuild hygiene, it is game-agnostic, and by style-guide §3 it belongs in
   `yulon/docker.py` with the rest of the shared Docker lifecycle, not in one
   game's maintenance module. It is not implemented anywhere yet; that is a
   checklist item, not a gap this file should fill badly.

**There is no `apply_sql()` either.** `apply.DockerSql.run_file()` and
`.run_statement()` already are "apply raw SQL against the appropriate
database", they already keep the password out of argv, and the applier already
routes every manifest SQL step through them. A third spelling would be a
style-guide §4 duplicate. What "SQL changes" needs that did *not* exist is the
half `wow-manage.sh` does before every SQL mod it ships — take a backup first —
and that is `backup(..., only=("acore_world",))`.

**Restore.** This is the one operation here that destroys player data, so it is
plan-then-apply, like `networking.plan()`/`apply()`, and the plan is a census
rather than a permission slip:

* `restore()` takes a `RestorePlan`, never a path, so a mistyped path fails in
  `plan_restore()` — before anything is touched — instead of part-way through.
* it refuses, rather than warns, while the worldserver or authserver is
  running. A live worldserver holds character state in memory and writes it
  back on save, so a restore under it is overwritten again within minutes: the
  operation would report success and then silently undo itself.
* `plan_restore()` re-runs inside `restore()` and both censuses must agree, the
  way `docker.stop_staged()` takes its census before acting and again after.
  A plan that was built while the server was down does not authorise a restore
  once it is up again.
* a restore that is interrupted (power, a killed process, a dead daemon) leaves
  the marker written in step 4 behind, so `interrupted_restore()` can tell a
  half-applied database from a finished one — mysql applies a dump statement by
  statement and has no other trace. A safety dump of what is about to be
  overwritten is taken first and named in that marker, which is the only thing
  that makes the half state recoverable.
* that marker is evidence about the databases whose copies it points at, and
  about nothing else. A restore skips the safety dump for exactly those
  databases an earlier marker already holds a usable copy of, and dumps every
  other database it is about to overwrite. Until 2026-08-23 the decision was
  made once for all of them, by asking whether the marker file existed.

**Not implemented, deliberately:** compression (see `_dump_argv()`), pruning old
backups (deleting a user's backups is destructive, nobody asked for it, and
`wow-manage.sh`'s keep-the-last-2 is a policy for a caller to choose), and
restoring a `.sql.gz` written by `wow-manage.sh` (`plan_restore()` refuses it by
name and says what to run).

Everything that reaches Docker goes through the `MysqlDocker` seam, so the unit
tests need neither a daemon nor a database.

        `--databases` (rather than a bare name) is what makes the file
        self-describing: it emits `CREATE DATABASE`/`USE`, so `plan_restore()`
        can read the target out of the file instead of guessing it from the
        filename the way `wow-manage.sh` does — where renaming a backup makes
        the tool ask the user which database it was.

        `--single-transaction` takes the dump inside one consistent read view,
        so a backup can be taken while people are playing without locking them
        out. It only covers transactional (InnoDB) tables; anything
        non-transactional is dumped as it is found. The alternative,
        `--lock-tables`, holds the whole schema still for the length of a
        multi-gigabyte dump, which on a live server is the worse trade.

        `--routines` and `--events` are asked for because their absence is
        silent: a dump without them restores cleanly and is simply missing
        things. `--triggers` is mysqldump's default and is named anyway, so the
        set is a list rather than a list plus an assumption.

        **`--add-drop-database` is deliberately NOT asked for, and that makes a
        restore a merge rather than a replacement.** mysqldump emits
        `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` before each table it carries and no
        `DROP DATABASE` at all, so loading this file replaces every table the
        backup holds and leaves every table it does not. Measured on Windows 11
        / Docker 29.7.2 (2026-08-23): a table created in `acore_world` after the
        backup was taken was still there after a full 306 MB restore of that
        schema — 313 tables where the backup had 312.

        That is the safer of the two, which is why it stays. Adding the flag
        would make a restore drop the whole schema first, so a load that dies
        part-way — a killed process, a full disk, the connection going — would
        leave *nothing* where today it leaves a database missing only whatever
        the load had not reached. The recovery story here is built on the second
        shape: `interrupted_restore()` reports a half-applied database and names
        the safety copy taken beforehand.

        What it costs is stated rather than hidden: a restore does not return a
        schema to exactly the state the backup describes. `restore()` says so.

        Not compressed. Compression would put this process back in the data path
        for the whole payload, and the plain `.sql` produced here is exactly
        what the guide's own restore line consumes.

       a picked wrong path, a half-downloaded file — is rejected as such;
    3. it ends with `-- Dump completed`, which mysqldump writes after the last

    **What "overwrite" means here, exactly: every table the backup holds is
    replaced, and every table it does not hold is left alone.** A restore is
    therefore a merge, not a return to the state the backup describes — a table
    created since it was taken survives it. This follows from `_dump_argv()`
    declining `--add-drop-database`, which is a deliberate choice recorded
    there, and it was measured rather than reasoned about: a marker table made
    after the backup was still in `acore_world` after a full 306 MB restore of
    that schema (Windows 11 / Docker 29.7.2, 2026-08-23). Rows inside a table
    the backup does carry are replaced wholesale, which is the case a user
    restoring characters is actually in.

    The order is: re-census, safety dump, marker, load, marker removed. The
    marker is what makes the middle of that sequence recognisable afterwards —
    if this raises or the process dies, `interrupted_restore()` reports what was
    in flight and where the safety copy is.

    A database an `interrupted` marker already holds a usable copy of does NOT
    get a fresh safety dump: it is already part-overwritten, so dumping it now
    would capture the mess and the pointer to the last good copy would be lost.
    That copy is carried forward instead. Every other database this restore
    overwrites is dumped, including when the marker cannot be parsed at all —
    such a marker names no database and stands in for nothing. Until 2026-08-23
    the presence of any marker file suppressed the dump for every database.

    Raises:
        MaintenanceError: the confirmation does not match, the plan no longer
