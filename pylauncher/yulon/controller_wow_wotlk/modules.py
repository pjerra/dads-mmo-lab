"""Module / ALE / mod / keg management for WotLK, driven by JSON manifests (roadmap 2.3).

This is the per-game binding only: the WotLK game id, where its bundled
manifests live, the GitHub location they are refreshed from, and the

loading/validating (`yulon.manifest_store`), applying (`yulon.apply`) — is

    `data/sql/db-world/*.sql` is left "to `ac-db-import` on next start", which

    three long-running services so a Start can never reach the importer, and
    `docker.repair_import()` refuses any install whose databases are already

    the list compiled into the image and not the folder on disk

    `docker_ctl.SPEC.import_service`, asked rather than respelled here
    (style-guide §3). Every refusal — ownership, strangers, and 8.7a's "not
    while the world is running" — belongs to `docker.apply_module_sql()`, so
    this route and the repair cannot come to disagree about whose install it is
    or when it is safe to write.

    `output` receives the importer's lines as they arrive; the `>> Applying
    update <file>.sql` lines among them are the only evidence that a module's
    SQL was applied, so a caller reporting to a user should pass one.

    `wsl_distro` says which daemon this install's containers are inside, and it
    is here because the route below takes one and this binding is what a caller
    holding the install reaches it through. Without it the whole run — the
    `compose config` probe, the database start and the importer itself — goes
    to the Windows host's Docker, which has never heard of `ac-database`, and

    other buttons are working (the shape of the 2026-08-27 Discord report).
