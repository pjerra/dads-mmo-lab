"""One verdict about one install, composed from state the app already has (8.1a).

The bug this closes, verbatim from `pyplan/bug-checklist.md:499`:

    HIGH — A TBC server whose mangosd is stuck in a restart loop is reported as
    a fully successful install, end to end through the GUI.

A crash-looping worldserver is in `docker ps` between its restarts, so every
check that asks "is a container running" answers yes, and the install reports
success while nobody can play. Two facts separate the two states and both come
from the single `docker inspect` this module already pays for: the restart
count, and how long the CURRENT run has lasted.

**Nothing here runs a command on the world thread**, on this timer or any other
(the decision page's "no periodic world-thread command, on any timer, for any
reason"). A tick is one `docker inspect` and, when the server is up, one SQL
read. That is also why `tick()` asks the database nothing when the world is
down: its database is down too, so the query would spend the tick timing out to
say what the container state already said.

Docker's restart policy increments `RestartCount` only when it revives a
container that DIED; a healthy boot, however slow, never increments it. So one
new restart is already abnormal -- and this used to call a loop on exactly
one, which is the false alarm photographed in 8.2b's own evidence: a healthy
server, the command-channel button greyed, "restart loop -- 1 restarts".

Three, because a single OOM-kill or a transient the next boot survives is a
hiccup, and calling that a loop trains users to ignore the warning; three
consecutive failures to get through boot is a pattern no healthy start
produces. The Rust launcher measured the same signal and wrote that reason down
(`origin/rust-main:crates/dml-wow/src/lifecycle.rs`, BOOT_LOOP_RESTART_STRIKES);
this port re-derived one strike without reading it, and the retrospective audit
of 2026-09-08 priced that. Owner's decision, the same day.

because a worldserver takes minutes to load its maps and a loop is therefore
quiet between crashes. Ten minutes is past any first-boot load measured on these
four trees and short enough that a server which really has settled stops being
