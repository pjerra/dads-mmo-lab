"""Typed reads over the server's own databases (Phase 8.1a).

Reads only. This module never calls the write half of the SQL seam, and that is
asserted over the syntax tree rather than left to review — see
`tests/test_write_ledger.py`. Owner answer 7 (2026-09-06) is the reason: nothing
in the app writes `characters` or `world` while the world is running, so the one
module that talks to those databases is the one that only ever asks questions.

## Identifying a bot

Two arms, always both, because each alone has failed in production and the
failures are recorded (`pyplan/phase8-reads/hypeer.md`, from `botid.rs`):

* **The registry alone fails open.** `playerbots_account_type` is filled in by
  the bot module as it goes, and on a freshly built install it can hold zero
  rows while a thousand bot characters play. `account NOT IN (<empty set>)` is
  true for every row, so every bot is reported as a person and the bot count
  reports zero — with nothing about the output looking wrong (incident
  2026-08-01).
* **The prefix alone fails closed, and worse.** An empty prefix compiles to
  `LIKE '%'`, which matches every account and calls the whole family bots
  (`botid.rs:33-38`). So a prefix that cannot be read is refused rather than
  defaulted or blanked.

## What is NOT resolved here, and is named rather than assumed

On AzerothCore an environment variable beats both the conf file and the compiled
default, **including for a key that is absent from the file**, and the naming
rule is generic rather than per-key: every ini key `X` is looked up as
`"AC_" + upper_snake(X)`, so `AiPlayerbot.RandomBotAccountPrefix` is
`AC_AI_PLAYERBOT_RANDOM_BOT_ACCOUNT_PREFIX`. That is measured, not derived —
`Config.cpp:435-438` for the name, `:370-374` and `:391-394` for the transform,
`:540-552` for env winning at read time — and the proof the rule is generic is
that the catalog already relies on it for `AiPlayerbot.MinRandomBots`. It is all
recorded in `pyplan/phase8-reads/azerothcore.md:119-124`.

**This module does not read that layer yet**, and that is a real gap rather than
an unknown one. It was written here as "unmeasured" until 2026-09-06, which was
wrong about the evidence: the answer was already in the phase's own read.

What the gap costs is bounded. Yu'lon's generated override sets no prefix key,
so on an install this app made, the conf-or-default answer is the one in force.
An install where somebody set that variable by hand produces a marker that reads
fine and matches nothing — which `population()` reports as a **warning** rather
than as zero, so it surfaces as a question instead of a wrong number.
