"""The database password that has to outlive the folder it was kept in (8.9a).

**The defect this exists for.** `purge.Uninstaller.run(keep_characters=True)`
keeps `<project>_db-data` and then deletes the server folder. On every
`generated` entry — `wow-tbc`, `wow-vanilla`, `wow-tortoise` — the password that
database was created with lives in `.db_password` INSIDE that folder, and
nowhere else. The volume name is a digest of the absolute path, so a reinstall
to the same folder comes back to the same volume with a freshly minted password
and stops at `CmangosInstaller._db_password`, which refuses to write a new
secret next to a database that exists. "Keep my characters" was therefore true
in the letter and false in the substance: what survived was a database nothing
could open. Found by the 8.9b lane reading 8.9a's code, 2026-09-08, before the
gate could find it the expensive way.

**The decision.** The secret is copied into Yu'lon's own config directory
BEFORE the folder is removed, and the reinstall looks there when the file is
gone. Three properties decided the shape:

* *It has to survive the delete.* Only somewhere outside the folder does, and
  the config dir is the one place this app already keeps per-install facts it
  must not lose (`credentials/`, `logs/`).
* *It has to be found again by a reinstall to the same folder, with nothing to
  go on but the folder.* So the key is `<game>-<install_id>`, the same
  path-derived pair `channel_setup.credential_path()` uses — `install_id()` is
  a hash of the absolute path, which is exactly what makes the reinstall land
  back on the kept volume in the first place. Same folder, same game, same key.
* *It must never claim more than it knows.* The file records the VOLUME the
  password opens, and the install stage that would otherwise refuse checks that
  name before it trusts the value. A copy kept for one volume can then never be
  used to argue about another.

**What it is not.** It is not a password manager and it is not a backup: it
holds one secret per install, written by the one action that would otherwise
destroy it. Nothing removes it — a purge that removes the volume leaves the
copy behind (`purge.LEFT_BEHIND` says so in the dialog), and that is harmless:
a fresh volume of the same name is INITIALISED with whatever password the
install resolves, so recalling the old one initialises the new database with it
rather than locking anything out.

**A refusal is the other half of the design.** If a ticked purge cannot read
the password it would have to keep, it removes nothing and says so
(`purge.Uninstaller.run`). Keeping a volume whose key is already lost is the
lie this module exists to stop, and doing it politely would not make it true.
