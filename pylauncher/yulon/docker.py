"""Shared Docker lifecycle helpers (game-agnostic).

Implements the Docker-CLI operations every per-game controller needs — start/stop
via `docker compose`, status/health/polling via `docker ps`/`docker inspect`/
`docker logs` — by shelling out through `yulon.runner`, which owns all subprocess
concerns (style-guide §3). This module is deliberately game-agnostic: the
per-game specifics (container names, published ports) are grouped in
`ContainerSpec` for readability/typing, and the `*_for(spec, ...)` convenience
wrappers accept a spec directly; the lower-level functions still take
individual container names/ports for callers that don't have a full spec.
Nothing in this module knows about any particular server.

The polling helpers mirror `dml-start.sh`'s `_wait_db_healthy` / `_wait_ready`
logic, generalized and given explicit, overridable timeouts.

    the by-name stop path exists for — so ownership would be unprovable at the
    one moment it is needed most, and a running server would be left up while
    the user is told it stopped.

    Every rule here was measured against the real `docker compose` rather than
    assumed, because a disagreement is not cosmetic: this value decides which
    containers the app believes are its own. Checked cases (review, 2026-08-22):

    * the LAST assignment wins, not the first — appending is exactly how a user
      follows the app's own "set COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=X in .env" advice;
    * `export ` is accepted;
    * an inline `# comment` is not part of the value — but a `#` inside quotes
      is, so it can only be stripped outside them;
    * surrounding single or double quotes are removed, and only a matched pair;
    * an empty assignment UNSETS it (compose falls back to the basename), so it
      cannot leave an earlier value standing;
    * a **UTF-8 byte-order mark** in front of the first line is not part of the
      first variable's name — see `utf-8-sig` below.

    `utf-8-sig`, not `utf-8`, and this one was found on Windows rather than
    reasoned about. `_stranger_message()` tells the user in as many words to add
    `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=<x>` to this file, and on Windows the tools they have
    to hand put a BOM in front of it: PowerShell 5.1's `Set-Content -Encoding
    utf8` writes `EF BB BF`, and Notepad's "UTF-8 with BOM" does the same.
    Decoded as plain `utf-8` that becomes a leading `\\ufeff` on the first line,
    so `startswith("COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=")` is False and the pin is invisible.

    What makes it a defect rather than a quirk is that **compose reads the same
    file and does not agree**. Measured on Windows 11 / Docker 29.7.2
    (2026-08-23): with a BOM'd `.env`, `docker compose config` reports the
    project as `bomtest` while this function reported `None`. The two then
    disagree about which project this install is, which is the exact condition
    `install_project()` exists to prevent — and the fallback that hides it,
    asking compose, is unavailable in the one case this function exists for (an
    install whose compose files cannot be read). It also made `pin_project_name()`
    believe nothing was pinned and append a SECOND assignment, where compose's
    last-one-wins then silently overrides whatever the user had set.

    `utf-8-sig` strips a BOM if there is one and is byte-for-byte `utf-8` if
    there is not, so nothing else changes. A UTF-16 `.env` — what PowerShell's
    bare `>` and `Out-File` write — is deliberately NOT handled: compose cannot
    read one either, so that file is broken for both of us and guessing at an
    encoding here would be the app inventing an agreement that does not exist.

    `docker compose up -d` with no arguments starts every service that has no
    running container — including AzerothCore's one-shot `ac-db-import` and
    `ac-client-data-init`, which have already exited successfully. Re-running
    the import is what `dml-start.sh` warns about in as many words:

        # Use docker start (not compose up) so we do NOT re-trigger ac-db-import
        # or ac-client-data-init on every restart — that was killing the database.

    Naming the three services explicitly is the whole fix: compose cannot select
    a service that was not asked for, and `--no-deps` stops it pulling the
    import back in as a dependency of the servers. Measured against Docker
    29.1.3, this single command:

    - never runs the one-shot import — not on a plain restart, not when a
      compose file changed, and not when a container is missing;
    - recreates a service whose configuration changed, so an edited port or
      `AC_*` value actually takes effect;
    - recreates a container that no longer exists, without treating "missing
      container" as "never installed";
    - waits for `ac-database` to report healthy before starting the servers,
      because upstream's compose declares `condition: service_healthy` — and
      **fails closed** if it never does, rather than starting a worldserver
      against a dead database.

    That last point is why there is no health-polling here any more. `compose`
    owns the dependency graph; restating it in Python was how the ordering came
    to be documented but not delivered.

    An earlier version of this function tried to be clever: it checked whether
    the containers existed, compared compose config hashes, and started
    containers by name with `docker start`, falling back to a bare
    `compose up -d` whenever it was unsure. Every one of those fallbacks ran the
    destructive command, so the feature defeated itself exactly when it mattered
    — on a missing container or a changed setting. It also looked up containers
    by *global* name, so with two installs of the same game it could start the
    other one, silently. Addressing the project by its directory means the
    command never names a container, though `port_conflicts()` still does.

    What `--no-deps` costs, stated plainly: it prunes every `depends_on` edge
    whose target is outside the selected set, which drops `ac-db-import` (the
    point) and ALSO `ac-client-data-init`'s
    `condition: service_completed_successfully`. So an install interrupted
    part-way through the multi-GB client-data download leaves an incomplete
    volume that upstream would have finished and this will not. That is a
    narrow case with a loud symptom (the worldserver complains about missing
    DBC/map data), and the alternative — putting the init back in the service
    list — is only safe if its entrypoint is idempotent, which is unverified
    (review, 2026-08-22).

    Returns:
        True once every named service is actually running. `compose up` exiting
        0 is not on its own evidence of that: it is happy to report success for
        a container that started and died, and the caller would then sit out
        `wait_ready()`'s full timeout before hearing about it.

    The deliberate teardown, for a project that needs recreating rather than
    restarting: a container wedged in a state `compose up` will not fix, a
    compose change that needs a fresh container, or clearing the way before an
    install is deleted by hand.

    WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO, because it is the whole reason the action is safe:
    it never removes a volume. The database lives in a named volume
    (`db-data:/var/lib/mysql` in an install this engine generated) and the
    client data in another, so `compose down` WITHOUT `-v` leaves every
    character exactly where it was. `-v` is the flag that would turn this into data loss, and a test
    asserts the argv never grows one.

    It also no longer costs the next start its database. An earlier version of
    this module warned that removing containers "forces the next start back onto
    `compose up -d`, and with it the one-shot database import" — that stopped
    being true when `start_staged()` began naming its three services explicitly.
    It selects `db auth world` and `--no-deps`, so compose cannot reach
    `ac-db-import` whether the containers are missing or not, and it recreates
    what is gone. The warning outlived the danger (2026-08-23).

    Ownership is proved the same way `stop_staged()` proves it, and refuses the
    same way, so the two actions cannot disagree about whose containers these
    are. `compose down` is project-scoped and would not touch a stranger anyway,

Docker's own default is 10, and 10 was measured killing a live save: a plain
`docker compose stop` against the populated worldserver on yulon-ubuntu came
back with exit code 137 (2026-08-23).

Measured on that box the same day — AzerothCore + playerbots, 1980 characters
online — two shutdowns run under a grace so long it could not bind
(`docker stop --timeout 900`) took **90.7s** and **73.4s**, both exit 0. A
third, run through `stop_staged()` itself with this constant in force, stopped
the whole project in **58.3s** with all three containers exit 0 and none of
them removed. So the same server, at the same population, varies by more than
half a minute between runs; the value has to cover the bad run.

Almost all of it is one phase. After `Halting process...` and `Logging out all
bots...` the worldserver logs `Closing down DatabasePool 'acore_characters'.
Waiting for 7662 queries to finish...` and then spends 86s, 69s and 52s in the
three samples draining that character save queue — 7400-7700 queued saves at
90-145 a second. The other two containers are nowhere near the constraint:
ac-authserver stopped in 0.22s and ac-database in 1.4s.

300 is therefore about 3.3x the worst thing seen. The margin is deliberately
generous and deliberately asymmetric. The queue depth scales with population
and drains at whatever the disk gives, so a larger realm or a slower disk moves
the number — while the only cost of an over-long grace is that a genuinely hung
server takes longer to give up, and the cost of being 30s short is a player's
characters rolled back to their last save. It happens to agree with the
`stop_grace_period: 5m` the earlier Rust launcher wrote into its generated
compose file (`pyplan/rust-prior-art.md` §2); that is now a confirmed number
rather than an inherited one.

This is the CLI grace on the stop path. The compose `stop_grace_period` key is
the same 300 seconds, and the install engine now writes it: see
`catalog/installers/wow-wotlk/native/base.yml.tmpl`, whose comment points back
at this constant. The two are meant to agree, and nothing enforces that they do
— they are read by different tools in different processes, so the only thing
holding them together is that both cite the same three measured shutdowns.

    The installer is the only thing that runs the import on a healthy path, and

    This is the repair for the one state that leaves behind: an install
    interrupted *after* its containers were created but *before* the import
    finished, whose Start now brings a worldserver up against empty schemas and
    fails in a way that explains nothing.

    It refuses far more often than it acts, and the refusals are the feature:

    * no `spec.import_service` — this game never said which service imports, and
      guessing a service name is guessing which container gets run;
    * ownership cannot be established, or containers wearing our names belong to
      another compose project. Identical to `remove_staged()`/`stop_staged()`, so
      the three cannot disagree about whose install this is;
    * an authserver or worldserver of this install is running. A live worldserver
      holds character state in memory, and the import writes underneath it;
    * the probe says the database holds player data. **This is the refusal that
      matters.** Re-importing over a populated database destroys characters, and
      it is not offered a second time for a user who asks twice — the way back
      from a bad database is Restore, which exists, and which was live-gated
      against a real 386 MB backup. On an install whose modules seed accounts
      this is also the refusal a *finished* repair leaves behind — pressing
      again lands here rather than on "already imported", which is a worse
      sentence for that case and still the right answer, since nothing can
      prove the rows are not a person's (see `DatabaseImport`);
    * the probe says the import already completed, or could not be asked at all.

    Two commands, both naming their service explicitly:

    1. `compose up -d --no-deps <db>`, only when the database is not already
       running. The import has to have somewhere to write, and the probe has to
       have something to ask — and a user cannot reach "database up, servers
       down" with the buttons this app has, since Start starts all three and
       Stop stops all three. Naming the database by hand is narrower than
       dropping `--no-deps` and letting compose's dependency graph decide what
       else comes up, which this repo has never measured.
    2. `compose up --no-deps <import_service>`, attached. `--no-deps` is what
       makes attached mode terminate: the one-shot is then the only container
       compose brings up, so `up` returns when it exits. Without it, `up` would
       also attach to the database and wait for a container that never stops.

    The exit code of that second command is not the answer, for the same reason
    `remove_staged()` does not believe `compose down`'s: the probe is run again
    afterwards, and only a database that is no longer repairable counts.

    Docker 29.1.3. Three things this docstring had asserted without a daemon:

    * *Attached `up` terminates.* It does, and so does the detached database
      start. One whole call took 209.0s against a one-shot container that ran
      208.0s, so `up` came back within about a second of the import exiting.
      The database half: 23s from `compose up -d --no-deps <db>` to healthy on
      a brand-new volume, and 7.1s start-to-refusal on an existing container.
      "A full import takes several minutes", which is what the button says, is
      the right order of magnitude — 215s and 208s for two full imports.
    * *`compose up` re-runs a one-shot whose container already exists and has
      exited.* It does, with no `--force-recreate`. The same `rt-ac-db-import`
      container went `StartedAt 16:59:10 → 17:05:06`, `FinishedAt 17:02:45 →
      17:08:34`, exit 0 both times, and the second run refilled three schemas
      that had been `DROP DATABASE`d in between.
    * *A finished import leaves `acore_auth.account` empty.* **False**, and
      this is what the post-check below had to change for — see the comment
      there.

    `output`, when given, receives each line of the import's STDOUT as it prints
    it. Not every line: `runner.stream()` withholds stderr until the child has
    exited and then yields it in one block, so anything the one-shot writes
    there — compose's own `Container ... Created/Started` progress among it —
    arrives at the end rather than live. That is the same trade `follow_logs()`
    makes and it is what keeps a full pipe from deadlocking the child, but a
    caller putting these lines on screen should not promise the user more than
    it delivers (review, 2026-08-23). What is guaranteed is:
    see `run_attached()`, which is what turned that second command from a
    10-30 minute silence into something a caller can show. It is called on
    whatever thread is running this, so a UI sink has to be one that can cross
    threads. Passing nothing changes nothing except that the lines are dropped
    instead of forwarded; they are retained and reported either way.

    **This cannot be cancelled, deliberately.** There is no cancel token here
    and the UI offers no Stop, because the only way to abandon a running
    `compose up` is to terminate it — which stops `ac-db-import` part-way
    through writing schemas. That is a recoverable state (the probe reads it as
    `partial` and this action is offered again), but it is not one to hand a
    user a button for while the alternative is waiting.

    Returns:
        True once the probe says the import finished — every schema filled,
        whether or not the run also seeded rows of its own.

    Raises:
        DockerCommandError: any of the refusals above, the database never became
            healthy, or the import ran and the databases still read as `absent`,
            `partial` or `unreadable`.

    """Stop this install without destroying its containers.

    The counterpart to `start_staged()`. `docker compose down` *removes* the
    containers, which is why it is not used here: a stop that removes leaves the
    next start with nothing to reuse. `compose stop` keeps them and walks the
    project's own `depends_on` graph, so the servers close their connections
    before the database goes away — upstream AzerothCore declares that graph and
    it is not ours to restate.

    The fallback stops this install's containers by name, one call at a time and
    in reverse order, for a project whose compose files cannot be read. Losing
    the ability to stop a running server because a file is missing would be a
    worse failure than losing the ordering guarantee. One call per container is
    not decorative: `docker stop a b c` signals all three at once (measured at
    6.19s for three containers where the *first* traps SIGTERM for 6s), so a
    multi-name call cannot express "world before the database".

    Both paths ask for `STOP_GRACE_SECONDS` instead of taking Docker's
    10-second default, which was measured SIGKILLing a populated worldserver
    while it was still flushing its character save queue. A Stop can therefore
    take minutes rather than seconds, and every caller of this runs it off the
    GUI thread already.

    Either way the result is verified rather than assumed. A zero exit from
    `compose stop` only means compose had nothing to complain about — it says
    so even for a project where nothing was running, and even where the
    containers holding these names belong to a different install. So the census
    is taken from `docker ps` plus the compose project label, once before the
    stop and again after it, and the exit code is never the answer.

    Returns:
        True if something of this install was running and is now down; False if
        there was nothing of it to stop. The old version returned `compose
        stop`'s exit code, which is 0 for an empty project — it said "stopped"
        having stopped nothing (review, 2026-08-22).

    Raises:
        DockerCommandError: Ownership could not be established, or something of
            this install is still running after the stop. Reporting success in
            either case would be the worst outcome: the user is told the server

    # prefers it over the directory — so copying an install (a second realm, a
    # restored backup) hands the copy the original's identity, and pressing Stop
    # in the copy stops the ORIGINAL's running server. Measured end to end.
    #
    # Not writing one does NOT make the copy safe, and an earlier version of

    # wrote, so that path carries the hazard too. This only declines to ADD a
    # third way in (review, 2026-08-23). The candidate real fix — reading the
    # containers' `com.docker.compose.project.working_dir` label and checking
    # whether that directory still exists, which separates a move from a copy —

    The streaming counterpart to `_docker()`, and the second site in this module
    that goes through `runner.stream()` rather than `runner.run()`. It lives
    beside `follow_logs()` for the reason recorded there: no `ui/` module builds
    a docker argv (style-guide §3), so a view that wants to show a command's
    output asks for a sink rather than for a subprocess.

    Why it exists: `_docker()` buffers a whole run into one string and returns
    it at the end, which for the database import means 10-30 minutes in which
    the caller has nothing to say and the user cannot tell a long job from a
    hung one. The argv is unchanged by this — only the reading of it is.

    Three deliberate differences from `runner.stream()`'s own contract:

    * **The exit status is returned, never raised.** `stream()` raises
      `CalledProcessError` once an exhausted generator finds a non-zero exit;
      that would take the decision away from callers who must go on and check
      something else (see `repair_import()`, where a one-shot that failed
      part-way and one that failed having done nothing exit alike).
    * **Only the last `keep` lines are retained** — see `KEEP_OUTPUT_LINES`.
      The sink sees every line, though not all of them live — stdout arrives as
      it is written and stderr in one block after the child exits. This process
      remembers a bounded end of them.
    * **A sink that raises is dropped, not propagated.** Letting it out would
      abandon the generator mid-iteration, and `stream()` terminates the child
      when that happens — so a widget deleted while an import was running would
      kill the import. The first failure is logged and nothing is sent onward
      after it.

    A host with no docker CLI comes back as `_CLI_MISSING_RETURNCODE` carrying
    `DOCKER_CLI_MISSING_HELP`, the same shape `_docker()` gives it, rather than
    as an exception — the callers here already have to handle a failed run.

    `cancel`, when set mid-run, stops reading and lets `runner.stream()`'s
    generator-abandonment path terminate the compose client. The result comes
    back as `CANCELLED_RETURNCODE`. What it does NOT do is stop work already
    handed to the daemon: BuildKit finishes the build step it is on, and a
    one-shot container keeps running to completion. That is desirable (the
    layer cache keeps the work, and a resumed install re-probes the databases)
    and it is the caller's job to say so, per stage — see
    `native.BUILD_CANCEL_NOTE` and its neighbours. `repair_import()`
    deliberately passes no cancel at all; see there.

    `merge_stderr` is for the build, whose entire progress output is stderr;
    see `runner.stream()`.

    run, so the clone appears to succeed, the build gets an empty context, and
    the first thing that reports the problem is a compile error hours later.

    **The exit code of an `ls` cannot detect that**, and an earlier version of
    this function claimed it could. `ls` on an empty directory exits 0, and the
    server directory is empty or absent at preflight time by construction — so
    against the silently-empty mount this exists for, the probe answered True
    and preflight printed `[pass] sharing the folder with Docker` (review,
    2026-08-23). What it can do is compare CONTENTS: mount a directory the host
    can see files in, and check the container sees files too.

    So the probe runs against the deepest ANCESTOR of `server_dir` that exists
    and has entries in it, not against `server_dir`. Two reasons, both
    load-bearing. Docker Desktop shares whole trees, so an ancestor's answer is
    the chosen folder's answer; and `-v <server_dir>:/probe` on a folder that
    does not exist yet makes Docker CREATE it, which put a directory on disk
    before `guard` had claimed it.

    `None` means the question could not be answered: no docker CLI, the daemon
    did not reply inside `timeout`, or no ancestor with anything in it could be
    found to compare against. That is preflight's *unchecked* tri-state, never a
    pass and never a refusal — a caller that read it as False would refuse an
    install that would have worked.

    Still unverified on macOS in the way that matters: that Docker Desktop
    mounts an unshared folder as empty rather than failing is inherited from
    the Rust launcher, and what a Mac actually does with an unshared path is
    exactly what nobody here can run. What a Mac HAS now produced (2026-08-26)
    is the other half — this function refusing a folder that was shared —
    which is what the second question below exists for.
