"""What removing a server from Yu'lon says, and the facts it is said from (T95).

Removing is not uninstalling (owner decision 1, 2026-09-23). The folder, the
database volume, the images and the (stopped) containers all stay. What goes is
Yu'lon's record of the server: its tab, its `state.json` row, and the Catalog
tile's "Installed".

Qt-free for `dashboard.line()`'s reason. Every sentence a person reads before
letting go of a server is asserted here without a widget, and `main.py` only
chooses which one to show.

How to bring a server back depends on the install type, and a sentence that is
true of one type is false of another:

* On this host, built by Yu'lon or adopted: "Use existing…" on the Catalog
  tile, pointed at the same folder. The m910q gate brought a removed TBC
  server back that way (T95, 2026-09-24). That is the way back this dialog
  offers, because it works for both. Installing into the same folder again
  also brings back a server Yu'lon BUILT -- the install resumes from its
  record, and since T112 its preflight no longer refuses the disk space the
  resume will not spend. T163/T164 sent players down that route to get
  compose files or images made again; since T170 one press does each
  (Repair server files…, Rebuild the server…). An adopted folder, with no
  record, is refused by the install outright, so this dialog does not offer
  that route.
* In a WSL distro: "Find in WSL…".
* Folder gone: nothing to bring back, and T34's promise about Docker, word
  for word.
