"""Cloning and updating git sources (game-agnostic).

Promoted out of `yulon.apply`, which owned the only clone seam the project had.
The native install engine (roadmap 6.2/6.3) needs the same operation for much
bigger sources — AzerothCore itself, its module tree, the client-data repo — on
machines that may not have `git` at all, so the seam becomes a module with two
implementations:

- `RunnerGit` shells out to the host's `git`, and is what Linux uses today.
- `ContainerGit` runs git *inside a container*, so macOS and Windows do not
  need a host git before they can install anything. Docker is already a hard
  requirement on those platforms; a second one would not be.

Both are `Git`, so the engine never learns which it got.

Two traps are baked in here rather than left for each caller to remember:

- **`core.autocrlf`.** Git for Windows defaults it to `true`, which rewrites
  AzerothCore's entrypoint `.sh` files to CRLF on checkout. That does not fail
  the clone, or the configure, or the build — it fails at *runtime*, as
  `/bin/sh^M: bad interpreter`, after a three-hour compile. Every clone here
  pins `core.autocrlf=false` and `core.eol=lf`.
- **Depth.** A shallow clone is much faster, but AzerothCore's CMake derives
  its revision string from git metadata, so the core wants a full one. Depth is
  therefore a field on `CloneSpec` and not a constant: the caller that knows
  which source it is asks for what that source needs.

        whose PATH does not yet mention docker — the first clone of a first
        install, minutes after `ensure_docker()` put it there.

        Both ways of having no docker end at the same sentence. `None` is "it
        was never found"; the `OSError` is the case the resolution cache cannot
        follow — a hit is remembered for the life of the process, so Docker
        uninstalled or self-updated while the launcher is open leaves that
        pinned path aimed at a file that is gone. Only the first was guarded
        when this moved off the literal `docker`, so the second still reached
        the user as `[WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified`

        no second spelling for a future command to be added to and forget, and
        the HTTP pin is simply inert without a network call.

        The line-ending half is not inert, and a review seat was right to say
        so. Forcing `core.autocrlf=false core.eol=lf` at `status` time is
        correct for a checkout THIS code cloned, because those are the same
        flags it was cloned under. Against a FOREIGN checkout — one the user
        already had, cloned with `autocrlf=true` so its files sit on disk with
        CRLF — the same flags make git compare unconverted bytes and report
        every such file as modified. `is_unmodified()` then answers False and
        `generate-compose` REFUSES, which is the safe direction (too strict,
        never overwriting), and it is unreachable today because every checkout
        the app asks about is one it made. It stops being unreachable the day
        an existing install can be attached, and that is the day to give the
        local calls their own argv.
