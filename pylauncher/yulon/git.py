"""Cloning and updating git sources (game-agnostic).

Promoted out of `yulon.apply`, which owned the only clone seam the project had.
The native install engine (roadmap 6.2/6.3) needs the same operation for much
bigger sources — AzerothCore itself, its module tree, the client-data repo — on
machines that may not have `git` at all, so the seam becomes a module with two
implementations:

- `RunnerGit` shells out to the host's `git`, and is what Linux uses today.
- `ContainerGit` runs git *inside a container*, so macOS and Windows do not
  need a host git before they can install anything. Docker is already a hard
  requirement on those platforms; a second one would not be.

Both are `Git`, so the engine never learns which it got.

Two traps are baked in here rather than left for each caller to remember:

- **`core.autocrlf`.** Git for Windows defaults it to `true`, which rewrites
  AzerothCore's entrypoint `.sh` files to CRLF on checkout. That does not fail
  the clone, or the configure, or the build — it fails at *runtime*, as
  `/bin/sh^M: bad interpreter`, after a three-hour compile. Every clone here
  pins `core.autocrlf=false` and `core.eol=lf`.
- **Depth.** A shallow clone is much faster, but AzerothCore's CMake derives
  its revision string from git metadata, so the core wants a full one. Depth is
  therefore a field on `CloneSpec` and not a constant: the caller that knows
  which source it is asks for what that source needs.

# `core.fsmonitor=/git/fsm.sh`, `.gitattributes` of `* filter=evil` and
# `filter.evil.clean=/git/clean.sh`, with a plain

#     + --attr-source=<empty tree>  -> neither ran
#
# `--attr-source` is the one that reaches the filters: a clean/smudge driver is
# selected by a `filter` ATTRIBUTE, so cutting off the selection is the only
# mechanism there is — git offers no "run no filters" switch, and the driver
# NAMES come from the repository's own config, so there is nothing to enumerate
# and override. It is safe to require here because this argv only ever runs
# inside the pinned digest below (git 2.49.1) and `--attr-source` needs 2.40;
# the host-git `RunnerGit` is deliberately not given it.
#
# `--attr-source` covers the WORKING TREE's `.gitattributes` and NOTHING ELSE.
# Review measured the other two attribute sources on git 2.51.2, with a
# `filter.evil.clean` that logs when it runs:
#
#     .git/info/attributes      + --attr-source  -> the filter RAN
#     core.attributesFile (repo config) + same   -> the filter RAN
#     ... and + -c core.attributesFile=/dev/null -> it did not
#
# so `core.attributesFile` is in the list below, and `$GIT_DIR/info/attributes`
# is NOT closable by any flag. Both files are repository content in exactly the
# sense `core.fsmonitor` is, so this list does not make a hostile repository
# safe — it removes the easy routes and leaves one open.
#
# `--no-optional-locks` stops `status` refreshing `.git/index`, which is both a
# write the `:ro` mount would refuse and the trigger for the `post-index-change`
# hook; `core.hooksPath=/dev/null` is the belt to that braces, since a directory
# of hooks is also repository content. `--ignore-submodules=all` does the same
# for a nested repository — a SECOND set of repository-chosen programs — but it
# is a `status` option rather than a top-level one, so it lives at
# `is_unmodified()`'s call site instead of in this list.
#
# What this does NOT cover, said plainly rather than left to be discovered: git
# has no switch that disables filter DRIVERS themselves, only the attributes
# that select them — and it cannot override `$GIT_DIR/info/attributes` at all,
# so a repository that puts its `filter` attribute THERE still selects a driver
# despite every flag in this list. A future caller that needs real attributes
# gets no protection either. Whatever does run is contained by
# `_READ_ONLY_CONTAINER_ARGS` above and by nothing else, which is why that list

        The question `is_unmodified()` cannot answer. `git status --porcelain`
        compares the working tree and the index against HEAD, so a checkout in
        which the user COMMITTED their work is clean by that test and stays
        clean no matter how much of their work is in it. `reset --hard
        FETCH_HEAD` then moves HEAD, and those commits are only reachable
        through the reflog.

        `rev-list --count <target>..HEAD` is the whole answer: it counts the
        commits reachable from HEAD and not from the target, so zero means
        moving HEAD onto it discards no history.

        **The target is `FETCH_HEAD`, after this method does the fetch itself,
        and NOT a remote-tracking ref.** The obvious-looking
        `refs/remotes/origin/<branch>` — what this asked until 2026-09-01 —
        holds only for a branch the update NAMES. Measured against real git,
        `file://` remote, depth 1:

            $ git fetch origin HEAD          # what every branchless update runs
            * branch  HEAD -> FETCH_HEAD
            $ git rev-parse FETCH_HEAD                    -> 02fbb2a
            $ git rev-parse refs/remotes/origin/HEAD      -> e7a89c7   (stale)
            $ git rev-parse refs/remotes/origin/main      -> e7a89c7   (stale)

        A refspec given on the command line replaces the remote's configured
        one, so `fetch origin HEAD` opportunistically updates NOTHING:
        `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` is written once at clone time and never
        again by this code, and the default branch's own tracking ref is just
        as stale. So after ONE legitimate app-driven update, the old question
        answered "1 commit ahead" for a checkout the user had never touched,
        and the guard refused adoption for every module in the catalog — all 21
        `wow-wotlk` manifests omit `source.branch`, which is precisely the
        population this fact exists to let through. Resolving the remote's real
        default branch (`ls-remote --symref origin HEAD`) does not fix that: the
        measurement above shows `origin/main` stale too, so it would still need
        this fetch, and would then be a second network call answering a question
        `FETCH_HEAD` has already answered.

        `FETCH_HEAD` is also the *literal* thing `_update()` resets to, so the
        comparison stops predicting the update and simply reads it.

        **The cost is a network round trip inside an adoption check**, and it is
        paid knowingly. `_adoption_refusal()` asks this fact last, only once the
        claim file and the clean tree have both said yes, and the update is
        about to fetch the same refs a moment later. Nothing is written outside
        `.git` and no working tree is touched. When the network is down the
        fetch fails, this returns `None`, and `_adoption_refusal()` refuses —
        the same direction as every other `None` here, and an install that could
        not have fetched anyway. The refusal says which of the two it is: an
        offline user is told the remote could not be reached, and never that
        they have commits of their own, because this answer establishes nothing
        about that.

        Depth is deliberately not passed, for `_update()`'s reason: `git fetch
        --depth=1` truncates a full clone in place. Verified on a depth-1 clone
        that the shallow boundary survives this fetch and the count is still
        right.

        `None` when git could not be asked at all — no `.git`, a fetch that

    is bind-mounted, so the working tree lands on the host exactly as a native
    clone would leave it.

    On Linux the container's root would own every cloned file, so the current
    uid/gid is passed through; on Docker Desktop the file-sharing layer already
    maps ownership to the logged-in user, so no `--user` is passed and one must

    `os.getuid` does not exist on Windows; it exists on macOS. So every Mac got
    a `--user` the rule excludes, and the container saw the bind mount as
    `root:root`.

    **That was a real defect and it was not the macOS clone failure**, though
    it was recorded here as its cause. Measured 2026-08-29 against this exact

    `/git/.git: Permission denied`. The tester reported
    `/git/.git: No such file or directory` — EACCES against ENOENT, which is
    not the same failure and not the same investigation. ENOENT there means
    the container's `/git` had no directory behind it at `mkdir` time, and

    nobody on this project can run. The macOS failure is still open.

        this class exists for a machine that may have no git, so a question
        answered on the host would put the second prerequisite back.

        `RunnerGit.no_local_commits()` carries the reasoning — why the target is
        `FETCH_HEAD` after this method's own fetch and not a remote-tracking ref
        that a branchless `fetch origin HEAD` never refreshes, and what the
        network round trip buys. Both implementations must answer identically:
        a caller narrowing to `HistoryReader` never learns which one it got, and
        this is a guard's input, so a disagreement would be a guard that means
        something different on Windows than on Linux.

        **The fetch is `writes=True` and it has to be.** It writes `FETCH_HEAD`
        and new objects into `.git`, and — decisive — `_READ_ONLY_CONTAINER_ARGS`
        carries `--network none`, so a reader container cannot reach a remote at
        all. That brings the read-write mount and, on an enforcing SELinux box,
        the recursive `:z` relabel of `dest`. Safe only because of WHERE this is
        asked: `_adoption_refusal()` reaches fact 4 only after
        `server_dir_claim()` has said this app created the server directory, so
        the folder relabelled is one this app owns and is about to `fetch` into
        anyway — through the very same writer container `clone()`'s
        existing-checkout branch uses (`_run()` → `_capture(..., writes=True)`).
        This line named `_update()` until 2026-09-02, which is `RunnerGit`'s
        method and runs HOST git: no container, and not this class's update path
        at all. A future caller that
        asked this about a FOREIGN checkout would be relabelling somebody else's
        repository in order to decide whether to leave it alone; do not add one.

        The `rev-list` that follows stays `writes=False`: it answers from the
        objects the fetch just landed, needs no network, and there is no reason

        the `docker run`, then fails `/git/.git: No such file or directory` —
        the container's view of a brand-new bind mount had not caught up with
        the host's. Twelve immediate repeats of the identical command, on the
        identical machine, all succeeded; the failure did not recur once. That
        is the signature of a mount-propagation race, not a real clone failure,
        so one immediate retry is tried before falling back to host git — a
        fallback this class exists specifically to let a Mac without Xcode's
        Command Line Tools avoid needing.

        Deliberately narrow: only the exact "started, then ENOENT under /git"
        shape retries. Anything else (auth, network, a bad branch) raises on
        the first attempt exactly as before.

        `writes` says whether this invocation puts anything into `dest`, and it
        is keyword-only and mandatory so a new caller has to answer it rather
        than inherit an answer. It picks between two different containers. A
        writer gets a read-write mount, `:z` where SELinux is enforcing, and
        stays confined. A reader gets a `:ro` mount, `_READ_ONLY_CONTAINER_ARGS`,
        `_UNTRUSTED_REPO_ARGS`, and — where SELinux is enforcing, and only there
        — `--security-opt label:disable`. Never both labels, never neither; see
        the SELinux comment below.

        argv[0] comes from `platform.docker_program()` for the reason spelled
        out there: this class exists *because* Windows and macOS already have
        Docker Desktop, so it is by definition the git that runs on the machine
        whose PATH does not yet mention docker — the first clone of a first
        install, minutes after `ensure_docker()` put it there.

        Both ways of having no docker end at the same sentence. `None` is "it
        was never found"; the `OSError` is the case the resolution cache cannot
        follow — a hit is remembered for the life of the process, so Docker
        uninstalled or self-updated while the launcher is open leaves that
        pinned path aimed at a file that is gone. Only the first was guarded
        when this moved off the literal `docker`, so the second still reached
        the user as `[WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified`
        (review, 2026-08-23) — the exact failure the change was made to end.

        `_LINE_ENDING_ARGS` and `_HTTP_VERSION_ARGS` are applied to EVERY
        invocation this method makes, including the two that touch no network
        and no working tree — `remote get-url origin` and `is_unmodified()`'s
        `status --porcelain`. That is deliberate: one argv shape means there is
        no second spelling for a future command to be added to and forget, and
        the HTTP pin is simply inert without a network call.

        The line-ending half is not inert, and a review seat was right to say
        so. Forcing `core.autocrlf=false core.eol=lf` at `status` time is
        correct for a checkout THIS code cloned, because those are the same
        flags it was cloned under. Against a FOREIGN checkout — one the user
        already had, cloned with `autocrlf=true` so its files sit on disk with
        CRLF — the same flags make git compare unconverted bytes and report
        every such file as modified. `is_unmodified()` then answers False and
        `generate-compose` REFUSES, which is the safe direction (too strict,
        never overwriting), and it is unreachable today because every checkout
        the app asks about is one it made. It stops being unreachable the day
        an existing install can be attached, and that is the day to give the
        local calls their own argv.

        #     $ docker run --rm -v /home/pk/labtest:/git:z ... -c "touch /git/y"

        #
        # **`:z` for a write, `--security-opt label:disable` for a read, and the
        # difference is the mount source.** The preflight probe
        # deliberately mounts an ANCESTOR of the chosen folder — routinely the
        # user's whole home directory — so a `:z` there would recursively
        # relabel `$HOME` to `container_file_t` and break the desktop session.
        # This mount is the server directory itself, the folder the app just
        # created and owns; relabelling THAT is exactly what the install wants,
        # it is what `platform.relabel_for_containers()` does to it a few stages
        # later anyway, and every compose bind the engine generates for it
        # already carries the same `:z`.
        #
        # **Only for the calls that WRITE into `dest`.** `_capture()` is shared
        # with `remote_url()` and `is_unmodified()`, which ask a question and
        # change nothing — and a `:z` relabels the mount source recursively, so
        # asking would have rewritten the labels of the very folder the answer
        # is used to decide NOT to touch. That is not hypothetical: the first
        # press against a user's OWN checkout of the same repository is refused
        # by `native.refuse_unowned_checkout()`, and the evidence it refuses on
        # is `_remote_of()` -> `_git_remote_url()` -> `remote_url()` -> here.
        # The refusal's own words are "nothing was touched", and a relabel of
        # the user's git checkout would have made them false.
        #
        # **A read must still be able to SEE the folder, and unlabelled it
        # cannot.** Dropping the `:z` from the two questions was only half the
        # answer, and the half that was left out was measured the same day on
        # Fedora 44, Enforcing, against a user's own unlabelled checkout
        # (`unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0`):
        #
        #     $ docker run --rm -v /home/pk/ownco:/git ... remote get-url origin
        #     fatal: not a git repository (or any parent up to mount point /)

        #
        # and the folder's label is byte-identical afterwards, which is the
        # whole point. Note the SHAPE of the denial: the container cannot see
        # `.git` at all, so git does not report a permission error, it reports
        # that the directory is not a repository — so the failure arrives here
        # as an ordinary `GitError` and leaves as `None`, indistinguishable from
        # "there is no checkout here". Every enforcing box therefore answered
        # `None` for every foreign checkout it was asked about. That direction
        # is not free even where a guard catches it: `_clone_core()` refuses on
        # `has_git and existing is None` with "git would not say what it is a
        # checkout of ... Pick an empty folder", which is a true sentence about
        # a machine that could have answered perfectly well, told to a user
        # whose remedy is to delete a checkout.

        # container unconfined, in one place — and it keeps the three answers
        # three: `None` adds neither the label nor the flag.
        #
        # `filesystem_type()` is asked only when the answer can matter.
        # `bind_label()` is still the one place that decides — `enforcing is
        # True` is not re-implemented here, it is the precondition for the
        # `stat` being worth spawning at all. Off SELinux the label is `""`

        # pinned digest) that belonged to `docker.bind_mount_ok()`'s probe.
