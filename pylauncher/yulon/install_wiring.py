"""Wiring an install engine for the app: the per-game seams `catalog/` may not build itself.

`catalog/` must not import a `controller_*` package, and `repair.py` is what
knows the `acore_*` schema names that answer "does this install's database look
imported?". So the probe pair is assembled HERE and handed down — once, for
`main.py`'s Catalog tab, `ui/controller_view.py`'s Server tab and the CLI
harness alike. Before this module each of the first two hand-wrote the same
lambdas and the same fixed-password fallback, and the harness in
`catalog/installer.py` wrote a third copy behind a lazy import that broke the
layering rule it was under.

Also the CLI harness (`python -m yulon.install_wiring <game> [--server-dir]
[--client-dir]`), moved from `catalog/installer.py` for the same reason: it
must wire the probe, and it could not from inside `catalog/`.

No UI here (style-guide §3): this module knows entries, engines and seams. The
one thing that looks like UI, `_terminal_prompter`, is the harness's own stdio
and never reaches the GUI, which passes `ui/widgets/prompt.py` instead.

    Only for a game that names a one-shot import service: `repair.import_state()`
    looks for the `acore_*` schemas by name, so attaching it to every entry told
    a healthy CMaNGOS install its databases were never imported and offered it
    the destructive Repair button (review, 2026-08-23). `import_service` is the
    same fact `repair_import()` refuses on, so the two agree by construction.

    Both seams, because neither answers the whole question alone: `DockerMysql`
    can list schemas without naming one to connect to, `DockerSql` reads inside
    them. Both bind to THIS entry's db container, never `docker_ctl.SPEC.db`.

    Two facts travel with them that a bare `(container, password)` pair loses.
    `schemas=entry.schema_map()` is what keeps a CMaNGOS install off
    AzerothCore's `acore_*` names — this function holds both the entry and the
    seam, so it is one of the few places that can say which schemas exist here.
    `wsl_distro` is the other half of that sentence: the schemas say WHICH
    databases, the distro says which daemon they are inside, and without it a
    WSL-resident server's `docker exec` goes to the Windows-local daemon that
    has never heard of `ac-database`. It defaults to None because the Catalog
    tab and the CLI install locally; the Server tab knows the distro of an
    existing install and passes it.

    The password is deliberately the FIXED one and not a file read: this
    function has no `server_dir`, and it is only ever built for an entry that
    names an import service — wow-wotlk, whose plan is `fixed`. A game that
    generates its password can never reach the line.

    `apply` and the two controller modules are imported inside the function on
    purpose: `controller_wow_wotlk.modules` imports THIS module at module scope
    for `DEFAULT_DB_ROOT_PASSWORD`, so naming its package up top would close the
    import graph on itself the first time anything in that package moves.

    password the CLI parked at the prompt forever: no timeout, no error, a
    process that never exits. Reproduced on yulon-arch, which is not
    passwordless.

    Never returns None. Off a terminal there is nothing to type, and an empty
    answer is the failure path that ENDS: sudo refuses it, retries, gives up,
    and the caller's own guard exits non-zero; a y/n rule reads it as "no". A

    an install can raise, and the others are consent questions — "Add '$USER'
