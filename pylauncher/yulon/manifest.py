"""The manifest schema: typed models for module / ALE / mod / keg JSON (roadmap 2.1).

This is the data contract the whole project rests on (README §6): everything
`wow-manage.sh` hard-codes per module — repo, SQL, conf files and keys, files
to deploy, patches, client files, prompts — is expressed here as a closed set
of declarative primitives, so adding content is a JSON file, never Python
(style-guide §3/§4). The models are game-agnostic; the `game` field and the
manifest directory decide which controller consumes them.

Validation is strict on purpose: unknown fields are rejected (a typo must not
silently become a no-op), ids/game are acronym-only slugs (style-guide §6), and
`Source.repo` is checked against `ALLOWED_REPO_HOSTS` (README §3a — no piracy
sources, ever).

`python -m yulon.manifest --dump-schema` prints the JSON Schema for the
language-neutral copy kept at `manifests/schema/manifest.schema.json`.
