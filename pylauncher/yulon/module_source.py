"""Deriving a module manifest from a link or a folder the user supplied (checklist 8.7).

Game-agnostic and free of Qt, git and Docker (style-guide §3/§4): every function
here is a pure transformation of a string or a directory read, plus three small
writes under the app's own config directory. That is deliberate — it is what lets
every refusal SENTENCE a user can meet be asserted in `tests/test_module_source.py`
without a display to drive, and it is why a refusal can be raised on the GUI
thread before any job is queued.

**Nothing new is taught to the applier about what a module is.** These functions
build a `Manifest` the shipped schema already understands, and the same
`Applier.install()` every catalogued module goes through applies it. What is
derived is only what a bare repository can be known to be: it is a C++ module, it
is named for its own repository, it needs a rebuild, and — once the folder is on
disk — it has whatever `conf/*.conf.dist` and `data/sql/<db>/` the author put in
it. Nothing else is invented: no conf keys, no prompts, no `requires`, no NPCs,
no client files.

Prior art, so the divergences are legible. `dml wow module install --url <u>`
derived a key from the URL basename and refused anything not `mod-*`
(`RUST crates/dml-wow/src/modmgr.rs:198-207`, `modules.rs:42-50`), cloned it
`--depth 1` (`modmgr.rs:1812-1820`), activated a `.conf.dist` only when a REGISTRY
knew the module's conf name — so a custom module got `conf: "none"`
(`moduletail.rs:139-150`, `modules.rs:308`) — persisted nothing, re-discovering
custom modules on every list from `modules/*/.git` (`modules.rs:279-297`), and
described them with the line this module reuses verbatim (`modules.rs:38`). It had
no folder route at all. Two things here go further, each for a reason written at
the function: the conf name is DISCOVERED from the glob rather than looked up, and
the manifest is PERSISTED rather than re-derived, because a manifest is what the
Remove, update-check and SQL routes all take and a folder-copied module has no
`.git` to be re-discovered from.
