"""Packing a WHOLE server, and building it again on another computer from it (T601 level 2).

Level 1 (`move_flows`) moves accounts and characters into a server that already exists. Level 2
moves the server: every database (world included, so custom content and objects a GM placed come
along), the conf files with the player's Tuning, the module answers, the modules themselves (as
the repository and commit each clone was on, never as built files), the derived manifests of
modules added from a link, and the player's own Lua scripts. What a new install makes for
itself never travels: built images, map data, logs, backups, the client, the database password,
the channel credential and every `.yulon-*` record but one (the folder id among them: a copy must
make its own, T568). The one that travels is `.yulon-module-answers.json`, because it describes the
databases, which travel too.

Importing is a NEW install, never a load into an existing one: the catalog entry is copied with
each source's `rev` set to the packed commit (`pinned_entry`), the normal install engine runs on
that copy, and the server it builds is then given the modules, the confs and the data. The owner's
decision (2026-10-09): install at the PACKED version, then let the Server tab offer Update or
Return to the tested pin (`moved_in_revs`).

This file is the pure part and the pack. `MovedInInstall` (further down) is the import.
