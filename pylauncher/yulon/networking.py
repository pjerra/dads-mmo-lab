"""Networking auto-setup: LAN and internet play, as a plan the app executes (README §13).

Shared orchestration over `platform.py`'s firewall/IP helpers and the
catalog's port table (roadmap 3.4). `plan()` is pure — it computes exactly
what would be done for a mode, including the router steps the app CANNOT do
(DHCP reservation, TCP port forwarding) and the warnings it detected (ports
bound to 127.0.0.1, CGNAT, a dynamic public IP) — and `apply()` executes the
automatable part: firewall rules (via `sudo -n` on Linux, never a hanging
password prompt), the WSL2 portproxy, and the realmlist UPDATE in the auth
DB through the server's DB container. Every step that could not be done is
reported by name, with the exact commands to paste, instead of failing
silently (style-guide §3: this module holds behavior, `catalog.json` holds
the numbers).

Two commands in that set are not like the others and are treated as such:
`ufw enable` brings up a default-DENY-incoming policy, and `systemctl enable
--now firewalld` brings up a zone whose shipped `ssh` service is port 22 and
nothing else — so on the headless server this feature exists for, either can
end the operator's SSH session and every one after it. Nothing here turns a
firewall on unless asked to (`plan(enable_firewall=True)`), and when asked it
either keeps SSH reachable on the port the RUNNING system says sshd is using or
refuses and says so — on `NetworkPlan.refusals`, in `warnings`, and in
`NetworkReport.skipped`, because the gate that found this read two of those and
both were empty (bug-checklist §39).

A third command joined those two on 2026-09-04, and it is on the DEFAULT path:
`firewall-cmd --reload`. It brings nothing up, but it drops every rule that was
added without `--permanent`, and a runtime-only allow is how an admin keeps a
moved sshd alive while deciding. Measured on firewalld 2.2.3 in a fedora:41
container on m910q, from a real connection across the docker bridge: a listener
kept reachable by a runtime-only `--add-port` answered 200, the shipped plan
(`enable_firewall=False`, daemon running) ran its reload with `refusals=()` and
`warnings=()`, and the same request then answered 000. So the reload is held to
the same rule as the enables — SSH's port is written permanently BEFORE it, or
it is refused and the refusal says why — see `_guard_the_way_back_in()`.

firewalld is NOT ufw with different words, and the first attempt at the
paragraph above treated it as if it were. `ufw allow` stages a rule with ufw
inactive; `firewall-cmd --permanent` needs a daemon on the system bus and fails
outright without one — measured on firewalld 2.2.3-2.fc41, exit 252 with a bus
and no daemon, exit 36 with no bus at all — so withholding firewalld's start
while keeping its `firewall-cmd` lines opened NO ports on a box where the
daemon was down. `firewall-offline-cmd`, which ships in the same package, is
the tool for that state, and the state itself is knowable (`firewall-cmd
--state`). So the plan for firewalld is chosen from a reading of the daemon
rather than from ufw's shape — see `detect_firewalld_daemon()`.

Three more measurements on 2026-09-04 (round 4) changed what "resolved" means:

* The rule that settled a socket table only when every named owner was sshd's
  REFUSED on every real box it was run on. Root on m910q and on yulon-ubuntu:
  15 lines, 15 named, sshd on 22 — and docker-proxy, systemd-resolve, cupsd,
  tailscaled and teamviewerd each made the table "unplaced", so the default
  firewalld plan dropped its reload and port 22 with it. The rule now PLACES a
  named owner that is not an SSH daemon and not an init that could be fronting
  one — see `_sshd_listening_ports()`.
* An EMPTY table is not "no SSH here". Inside `sudo unshare --net` on m910q,
  `ss` listed nothing, the plan enabled ufw with nothing said, and from that
  same namespace `firewall-cmd --reload` reached the host's daemon and dropped
  its runtime allows — `/etc/ufw` and firewalld's config are the host's. An
  empty table is unresolved.
* firewalld ZONES. With eth0 bound to `internal` (firewalld 2.2.3, fedora:41)
  a route resolved on 2222 was written as `--permanent --add-port=2222/tcp`
  — the DEFAULT zone — and the reload left `internal` empty and ssh answering
  "No route to host". The ports go to every zone in use, or the reload is
  refused — see `detect_firewalld_zones()`. (Round 4 read "in use" off
  `--get-active-zones`, which round 5 measured as the wrong list; the sentence
  above is kept as what was true then.)

Round 5, 2026-09-05, changed WHO asks and WHAT is asked, not the shape of the
guard. Three measurements, each of which refuted a round-4 rule on a real box:

* The probe asked with less authority than the action. `plan()` runs in the
  GUI process at uid 1000; `ss --processes` cannot name a socket root holds,
  so on m910q (15 listeners, 2 named) and on yulon-ubuntu (7, 0 named) the
  table had holes, the route was unresolved, and every enable and every reload
  was refused — on every box, permanently. `apply()` already knew how to act
  with authority (`platform.elevation_policy()`), so the probes now ask with
  the same prefix: `sudo -n ss ...` reads 15/15 and 7/7 and both boxes resolve
  on port 22. See `probe_prefix()` and `plan(elevate=...)`.
* The zone list the ports were written to was the one the reload throws away.
  `--get-active-zones` is the RUNTIME binding; `FlushAllOnReload=yes` (shipped
  default) restores the PERMANENT one. Measured: three ports written to
  `work`+`public`, reload, eth0 back in `internal`, `refusals=0`, and ssh,
  curl and the game ports all dead. The permanent bindings are read now too
  and the ports go to both lists. See `FirewalldZoning`.
* "At least one line and no hole" is satisfiable by one placed listener. A
  private network namespace with a single root-owned `http.server` and no sshd
  settled as "no SSH here" and ran `ufw --force enable` against the host's
  `/etc/ufw`. The table is evidence only if it came from this machine's
  network namespace. See `in_host_network_namespace()`.

Round 6, 2026-09-05, is three more, each measured against round 5's own code
on m910q — the first two in a fedora:41 container with a real firewalld, a
real sshd on 2222 and a real connection across the docker bridge, the third in
a container given the host's own pid and network namespaces:

* The DEFAULT ZONE has two readings too, and round 5 used the wrong one. Every
  `firewall-cmd` listing tags `(default)` from the DAEMON; the reload installs
  `DefaultZone` from `/etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf`, which
  `firewall-offline-cmd --set-default-zone` will change under a running daemon
  in one supported call. Diverged (daemon `public`, file `work`), all three
  round-5 readings agreed, `moved_at_runtime` was empty, three ports went to
  `public`, apply ran 4/4 with refusals 0 and warnings 0 — and after the reload
  eth0 had no zone, `work` listed no ports and ssh answered "No route to host".
  The file is read now (it was already being read, six lines lower, for
  `FlushAllOnReload`) and its zone is written like any other. See
  `_FIREWALLD_DEFAULT_ZONE`.
* The union was silent, not wrong. With eth1 bound to a `wanzone` that allowed
  nothing, the game ports and the SSH port were written there too — apply 7/7,
  refusals 0, warnings 0, and the word `wanzone` in nothing the user could
  read. The breadth is kept, because both narrowings break the feature on an
  ordinary box, and every zone the ports go to is now named in the plan. See
  `plan()`.
* The guard asked which NETWORK namespace and never which MOUNT namespace.
  `docker run --privileged --pid=host --network=host` of a Fedora image on the
  Ubuntu host is in the initial pid namespace and in pid 1's network
  namespace, so round 5 answered True; `/etc/ufw` was absent from the
  filesystem it would have written, and the plan emitted `ufw allow 22/tcp`
  and `ufw --force enable` with 0 refusals. See `reads_this_machine()`.

Round 7, 2026-09-05, is round 6's review, re-derived on m910q before anything
was changed. Nothing here is a new lockout: two are sentences that named the
wrong thing, and one is a warning that fires where there is nothing to warn
about.

* A REFUSAL NAMED A CAUSE THAT WAS NOT THE CAUSE. `reads_this_machine()`
  collapsed three questions into one tri-state, so `False` had one sentence and
  it had to name every way of being False at once. Driving the round-6 module
  from inside `sudo unshare --net`: `/proc/self/ns/net` 4026533453 against pid
  1's 4026531840 — the cause — while `in_host_mount_namespace()` was True and
  `os.path.isdir('/etc/ufw')` was True, and the refusal read "this process is
  in a different mount namespace from pid 1, or the directory the firewall
  backend writes does not exist on the filesystem it can see". Both disjuncts
  false, the true one named nowhere. The cause is carried now, one sentence and
  one REMEDY each — see `where_the_reading_came_from()` and `READ_ELSEWHERE`.
* THE ZONE-BREADTH WARNING FIRED ON EVERY ORDINARY LINUX BOX. Round 6 gated it
  on `len(zones) > 1`, and Docker — which every Yu'lon Linux install requires —
  creates a firewalld zone named `docker` bound to `docker0`. Round 6's own
  clean run on yulon-fedora read `('FedoraWorkstation', 'docker')`; rebuilt for
  real in a fedora:41 container shaped the same way, the committed module told
  a healthy single-NIC box its game ports might face the internet and handed it
  a `--remove-port` for Docker's zone. The gate is the zones this machine did
  NOT make for its own containers — see `machine_made_zones()`.
* THE DECISION WAS NOT REACHABLE WITHOUT A PLAN. Every earlier round's guard
  was a branch inside `_guard_the_way_back_in()` that also edited the command
  list, so the two states this bug has cost the most — the daemon's default
  zone against the file's, and a second zone that is only Docker's — could not
  be varied one at a time. `decide_lockout()` is that decision as one function
  of one frozen `LockoutQuestion`, returning a reason token, a refusal that
  names a remedy, and the notes the user is owed whatever the verdict.

Two smaller ones from the same review: `reads_this_machine()` said "cheapest
first" and asked the free question second (measured at uid 1000 with
`backend="firewalld"` on m910q: one `sudo -n stat -L -c %i /proc/1/ns/net`
spent before the missing `/etc/firewalld` answered — now zero), and the breadth
sentence said the ports "are allowed in" zones where no reload had put them
(measured with the daemon stopped: eight offline writes, no reload, and the
same word) — it says WRITTEN unless the plan is about to put them in effect.

`enable_firewall=True` HAS NO CALLER as of 2026-09-04. The only production path
into `plan()` is `ui/controller_view.py`'s `network_plan=lambda mode:
networking.plan(entry, mode, bindings=...)`, which does not pass it, and no UI
element sets it — so every plan the app can produce today withholds the enable
and carries the refusal, and the guarded-enable path below is reachable only
from tests. That is recorded rather than fixed because the wiring is a product
decision, not a repair: it needs a control on the networking tab, a sentence
saying what turning the firewall on costs, and `ControllerServices.network_plan`
widened to carry the answer. Read the ENABLE half of the guard as what must
already be true before that control exists; the RELOAD half is on the path
users hit today, which is why it is not gated on `enable_firewall`.

service what its public address is — and `advertisable()` sits in front of both

advertising the loopback tells every client the world server is on the CLIENT's
machine). `loopback` is the one mode whose address is not detected but CHOSEN,

INTENT_FILE = ".yulon-network.json"
"""Where a chosen `Mode` is remembered, beside `.yulon-install.json` and not inside it.

Two reasons, both measured rather than argued.

The first is who owns the file. `native.write_state()` rebuilds its whole
payload from the keys the running build knows and `os.replace()`s the result,
and the install engine carries ONE `InstallState` in memory for a whole run,
writing it back after every recorded stage. An intent written into that file by
anyone else -- the Networking tab, which is another thread of the same app --
is therefore dropped by the engine's next write, with no conflict for either
side to notice. That is the same class of loss `InstallState.unknown` exists to
prevent, and
`test_networking.py::test_the_recorded_intent_survives_the_install_engine_rewriting_its_state_file`
is what would catch its return.

The second is what the two files are FOR. `.yulon-install.json` records what a
run got through, and `read_claim()` refuses to open one written by a newer build
at all rather than risk rewriting it. The mode a person chose is not a run's
progress and must not be readable only when a run's record happens to parse.

Both files live in the server directory and both are removed by a fresh
`clone-core` (`git.py`'s seams empty a destination with no `.git`), so this
choice buys nothing there and loses nothing either: a folder being cloned into
for the first time has no chosen mode to lose.

A `NetworkPlan.warning` rather than a refusal, because the plan is going to do
exactly what was asked. It is here rather than in the radio's label because the
label has room for the address and not for the consequence, and because
`_format_plan()` renders warnings — so this is the sentence a person reads in
the same widget, one press before it takes effect.

"reach" here means "get to this server to play on it", not "open a socket to
it", and the wording was reviewed against the machine rather than kept by
default. Read on yulon-ubuntu 2026-09-06 06:27:43 +02:00, on the install the
04:43 loopback Apply had run against: `docker ps --format
'{{.Names}}\t{{.Ports}}'` printed `ac-authserver 0.0.0.0:3724->3724/tcp` and

`0.0.0.0:3724` and `0.0.0.0:8085` — so the mode binds nothing shut and another
machine can still connect and log in. What it cannot do is play: the colon
clause of this sentence is the whole mechanism, and it is what the reader is
given. The sentence was
kept as it stands rather than reworded to "play on" because it is quoted, live,
in two committed records of the presses that closed §41
(`pyplan/gates/bug41-loopback-2026-09-05/widget-driver-output.txt` lines 31 and

hole is not opened for this mode does NOT rest on this sentence: that reason is

this sentence being read as the reason that put a false claim in that comment

in my two runs); it is there when `/proc` has been remounted for the new pid
namespace, and `systemd` when it has not. That is what `--mount-proc` decides,
and round 8's table left it off: labelled `unshare --net --pid --fork`, its row
showed pid 1's `ns/net` equal to the NEW namespace, which only the
`--mount-proc` spelling produces. Without it the caller's `/proc` is inherited,
`/proc/1` is still this machine's init, and pid 1's `ns/net` is the host's.
Both spellings are listed above rather than one, because `/proc/self/ns/pid`
reads a NON-INITIAL inode in both — not the same inode, which the two rows
above refute at a glance (4026533509 against 4026533621, and 4026533509 against
4026533510 for the `--pid --fork` pair; a re-run of the `--net --pid --fork`
pair at 17:05 UTC that day read 4026533620 and 4026533510, different again) —
and the only question this module
asks of that inode is whether it is the initial one, which answers False in
both.
Every container runtime measured here remounts `/proc`, which is why the
`docker` row looks like the `--mount-proc` rows and not like its own kernel
flags.

0xEFFFFFFC is 4026531836, and it is the ns/pid value on both real boxes and on

one: yulon-ubuntu's initial net namespace is 4026531833 and m910q's is

    True, False, or None for "could not tell" — three answers, because the
    caller refuses on the last two and a bool would have to pick which.

    This is the question every namespace refutation has actually been about,
    asked directly instead of inferred from the shape of the table. `ss` lists
    the sockets of the network namespace it is called in; `/etc/ufw`,
    `/etc/firewalld` and firewalld's D-Bus are the HOST's from inside
    `unshare --net`, which shares the filesystem. So a table read in another
    namespace is a true statement about the wrong machine.

    Measured on m910q, 2026-09-04, driving the whole round-4 module (`plan()`
    with `enable_firewall=True`, ufw) from inside each environment:

        environment                              table                    round 4
        `unshare --net`, one root-owned python3  1 line, named, no sshd   ENABLE RUNS
        `unshare --net`, sshd of its own on 2222 2 lines, named, sshd     ENABLE RUNS
        `unshare --net --pid --fork`, own sshd   2 lines, named, sshd     ENABLE RUNS

    all three with `refusals=0`, on a host whose sshd is on 22 and whose
    `/etc/ufw` the namespace shares. The first is blocker 3's route — a table
    that resolves only because it is nearly empty — and the rule that closes it
    is NOT "there must be an sshd on it": a Fedora desktop with no sshd is the
    ordinary case, and refusing there would leave a home user's game ports
    written permanently and never reloaded. What closes all three is asking
    which namespace the reading came from.

    Two halves, because one namespace escape hides the other:

    * `/proc/self/ns/pid` must be the INITIAL pid namespace
      (`_INITIAL_PID_NAMESPACE_INO`). Otherwise `/proc/1` MAY be the
      namespace's own init rather than the machine's, and comparing against it
      would compare a thing to itself — which is what the two `--mount-proc`
      rows and the `docker` row of that table do. It may also still be this
      machine's `systemd`, as the un-remounted `unshare` rows are; this read
      cannot tell the two apart, and this half refuses both. What that costs is
      measured in `in_initial_pid_namespace()`. This half is free and needs no
      privilege.
    * `/proc/self/ns/net` must be pid 1's. That is the reading `unshare --net`
      breaks while leaving pid 1 the host's.

    The price, measured on 2026-09-04: a launcher running INSIDE a container
    (`docker run`, the last row of `_INITIAL_PID_NAMESPACE_INO`'s table) is not in
    the initial pid namespace and gets False here. What that sentence went on
    to claim — "that is a refusal on a deployment shape nothing in this product
    ships" — was refuted on 2026-09-05 by `docker run --pid=host
    --network=host`, which is in the initial pid namespace AND in pid 1's
    network namespace and answers True here while writing another filesystem's
    config; see `in_host_mount_namespace()` and `reads_this_machine()`. This
    function's own answer is unchanged and correct: that container really is
    reading the host's sockets.

    Round 8 measured what that False costs when it is turned into a CAUSE.
    m910q, 2026-09-05, `docker run --rm --network=host fw41img` (fedora:41,
    `/etc/firewalld` present), read from inside the container:

        /proc/self/ns/pid  4026533512   not the initial one
        /proc/self/ns/net  4026531840 == /proc/1/ns/net  4026531840
        /proc/self/ns/mnt  4026533509 == /proc/1/ns/mnt  4026533509

    Both comparisons said "same as pid 1" because pid 1 THERE is the
    container's own init, and the host's mount namespace (4026531841, read on
    the host the same minute) is nowhere in that table. So this function's
    False is right to refuse and wrong to be read as "the network namespace
    differs" — it does not, and 4026531840 is the host's. That is why
    `where_the_reading_came_from()` asks `in_initial_pid_namespace()` on its
    own and returns `"other-pid-namespace"` before it looks at either
    comparison.

    The precondition both namespace comparisons rest on, asked as its own
    question because it has its own answer for the user. True is the only value
    under which `/proc/1` is certainly this machine's init; False says the pid
    namespace is somebody's own, and NOT — this is round 8's overreach — that
    `/proc/1` is that namespace's init. Which of the two it is depends on

                                        own — a comparison against it compares
                                        the namespace with itself
        `unshare --pid --fork`          /proc/1 is this machine's `systemd`,

                                        the same minute — both comparisons
                                        would have been right

    `/proc/self/ns/pid` reads a non-initial inode in both, so this function
    cannot separate them and `where_the_reading_came_from()` refuses both. In
    the second shape that is a FALSE refusal of a healthy reading, and the
    price is paid on purpose:

    * `/proc/1/ns/pid` would separate them, and it is not free. Measured at uid
      1000 on m910q that day, `os.stat` of all three of `/proc/1/ns/pid`,
      `/proc/1/ns/net` and `/proc/1/ns/mnt` raised `EACCES`; only `sudo -n stat
      -L -c %i /proc/1/ns/pid` answered (4026531836). So the read costs the
      same elevation fallback the network and mount questions already pay, and
      where no prefix is available it answers None — turning today's refusal,
      which carries a remedy the user can act on, into `"unknown"`, whose
      remedy is "give the launcher sudo".
    * What it would buy is one shape: a process in its own pid namespace that
      did not remount `/proc` and is otherwise the host's. `unshare --pid
      --fork` from a shell is that shape; every container runtime measured here
      remounts `/proc` and is not.
    * What today's refusal costs that shape is a sentence telling the user to
      run the step outside `unshare --pid`, which is correct advice in both
      shapes and costs them one shell.

    Free — one `stat` of `/proc/self/ns/pid`, no subprocess, no privilege, no
    elevation fallback. None only where `/proc/self/ns` is not there at all
    (not Linux, or a `/proc` mounted without it), which is the same None
    `_same_namespace_as_pid1()` returns for the same reason.

    FOUR questions, and the FIRST that answers not-this-machine is the answer
    returned — so the caller gets the cause, not a disjunction of every cause.
    Genuinely cheapest first, which round 6 claimed and did not do:

    * the backend's config directory — does the file these commands edit even
      exist here (`_BACKEND_CONFIG_DIR`). Free: one `isdir`, no subprocess, no
      privilege. Round 6 asked it SECOND while its docstring called it free,
      and measured on m910q 2026-09-05 at uid 1000 with `backend="firewalld"`
      (a box with no `/etc/firewalld`) that cost one `sudo -n stat -L -c %i
      /proc/1/ns/net` before the free decisive question was reached.
    * the pid namespace — is this the initial one at all
      (`in_initial_pid_namespace()`). Free as well, and asked BEFORE the two
      comparisons because it is the precondition for both of them: outside the
      initial pid namespace, `/proc/1` may be that namespace's own init and
      comparing against it compares a namespace with itself. May, not is —
      measured both ways on m910q on 2026-09-05, and the refusal covers both
      because separating them is not free; see `in_initial_pid_namespace()`.
      Round 7 folded this into
      `in_host_network_namespace()`'s False and so named the network namespace
      as the cause for a process whose network namespace was pid 1's own.
      Measured on m910q, 2026-09-05, `docker run --rm --network=host` of a
      fedora:41 image carrying `/etc/firewalld`, running the round-7 module in
      there: self net 4026531840 (the host's, read on the host the same
      minute), and `where_the_reading_came_from("firewalld")` returned
      `"other-network-namespace"`, whose remedy ends "apply them with the
      firewall tool inside it" — which writes the container's own
      `/etc/firewalld`, the thing `"other-mount-namespace"` exists to prevent.
    * the network namespace — whose sockets are these (round 5's question,
      unchanged and still correct);
    * the mount namespace — is that directory pid 1's copy of it, which is the
      question `/etc/firewalld` existing inside a Fedora container cannot
      answer for itself.

    """What the RUNNING system says about SSH being a way into this machine.

    Three fields, because the question has three answers and collapsing any two
    of them is how bug-checklist §39 happened:

    * `connected` — this process's session arrived over SSH. True is proof of a
      remote operator. False is NOT proof of a local one: `sudo` resets the
      environment, a systemd unit never had it, and a `tmux` session started at
      the console keeps none of it while its owner attaches over SSH from a
      beach. So False is used to allow nothing on its own.
    * `ports` — every port that has to keep admitting SSH.
    * `listeners_readable` — whether an empty `ports` SETTLED the question. An
      empty `ports` from a probe that read the socket table and an empty
      `ports` from a probe that was not allowed to read it are the same tuple
      and opposite facts, and only the first one means "there is no SSH here to
      lock out". Keeping them apart is the difference between a decision and a
      guess.

      It is True only when the socket table SETTLED the question, which takes
      more than the probe having read SOME line and more than the probe being
      root. The first fix set it from "any line carried an owner", and on m910q
      the one line that did was GNOME's RDP listener — this user's own socket —
      while sshd's two lines were ownerless because sshd is root's; the second
      set it from euid 0, and root in a PID namespace named none of the host's
      14 listeners while answering yes; the third gated the empty answer on
      those unnamed lines and let a NON-empty answer through ungated, so root
      in a namespace with an sshd of its own on 2222 reported `(2222,), True`
      next to the host's unnamed `0.0.0.0:22`. All three came out as a plan
      that enabled a default-deny firewall on a box running an sshd it had not
      seen. The fourth went the other way: every named owner that was not
      sshd made the table unsettled, and on m910q and yulon-ubuntu as root
      (2026-09-04) that was docker-proxy, resolved, cups and tailscale — so
      the guard refused on every real box and allowed on none. See
      `_sshd_listening_ports()` for the rule that decides it now.

      An EMPTY table is False too. Measured on m910q the same day inside
      `sudo unshare --net`: `ss` returned 0 with no lines, and from that
      namespace `systemctl is-active ssh` still said `active` and
      `firewall-cmd --reload` reached the host's daemon and dropped its
      runtime allows. A private network namespace shows no listener while the
      firewall config it would write is the host's.

      It is read on BOTH sides of the guard's port test, not just when `ports`
      is empty: a port from `SSH_CONNECTION` is proof of one way in and no
      evidence at all that it is the only one.
    * `read_elsewhere` — set when `listeners_readable` is False BECAUSE the
      reading was not this machine's (`where_the_reading_came_from()` named a
      cause), carrying the sentence for THAT cause and the remedy for it. None
      when the table itself was the problem. Its own field because the two are dropped for
      opposite reasons and the refusal used to name only the first: in the
      `--pid=host --network=host` measurement the table had no holes at all —
      15 lines, every one named, sshd on 22 — so "this machine's listening
      sockets could not all be accounted for" would have been a false reason
      attached to a correct refusal.

    Two sources, unioned rather than ranked, because they answer slightly
    different questions:

    * `SSH_CONNECTION` (and `SSH_CLIENT`, which some setups still export) names
      the port THIS session arrived on — field four is the server-side port
      sshd accepted us on. That is the one port provably admitting the operator
      standing here, and it is free: no subprocess, no privilege.
    * `ss` names every port sshd is listening on, which covers the operator who
      is not here yet — a firewall that cuts tomorrow's login is the same bug
      one day later — and the case where the environment was stripped.

    Neither is sufficient alone: the environment is gone under `sudo`, in a
    systemd unit and inside a `tmux` session that predates the login, and the
    socket table is unreadable to a probe that is not root.

    There used to be a third seam here, `reads_root_sockets`, answering "could
    this probe have named the owner of a socket root holds" from the euid and
    `/proc`. It was removed on 2026-09-04 because no table exists on which its
    answer changes the verdict: an unnamed line already unsettles the table
    whatever the probe's privilege, and a named line is placed by its name, not
    by who read it. A seam that cannot change an answer is a check that is not
    happening, and its docstring said it "gated BOTH answers" while the branch
    that returned ports never called it.

    `prefix` is the authority the `ss` probe runs with, from `probe_prefix()`:
    without it, uid 1000 reads root's sshd as an unnamed line and every plan
    refuses (see `probe_prefix()` for the measurement on both boxes).

    defaults to `where_the_reading_came_from()` bound to the same `run`, the
    same `prefix` and `backend` — one authority for every question this
    function asks, and one machine. It answers with a CAUSE rather than a
    bool so the refusal can name the one that fired; round 6 passed a
    tri-state and the sentence had to name every cause at once (see
    `READ_ELSEWHERE`). `backend` is what lets it ask whether the config
    these rules will be written to exists here; `plan()` always passes it, and

    """(ports an SSH daemon is listening on, whether the TABLE settled, whose MACHINE it is).

    The second and third halves are the load-bearing ones, and the caller must
    have BOTH before it uses the ports. They are returned apart because they
    are dropped for opposite reasons and a caller that has to explain the drop
    cannot reconstruct which one it was: the third is `where_read()`'s answer
    when the table settled, and a documented `THIS_MACHINE` — "not the reason"
    — when it did not, since the question is asked last and an already-unsettled
    table never spends the subprocess it can cost.

    The table half is decided by ONE rule, at the return, for the ports found
    and for an empty answer alike. Every line of the table is one of four
    things:

    * UNNAMED — no `users:(` column. The probe could not attribute it: a
      root-owned socket read by uid 1000, or any socket read by root in a PID
      namespace whose `/proc` holds none of the host's processes. A hole.
    * an SSH DAEMON — an owner whose name reads as one (`_SSH_DAEMON_TOKENS`).
      Its port goes into `ports`. A port that will not parse is an SSH daemon
      HERE on a port nobody knows, the worst line there is, and is a hole.
    * a socket FRONT — `_SOCKET_FRONTS`, or whatever is pid 1. The name says
      nothing about what will answer on that port. A hole.
    * anything else — PLACED, as not SSH: docker-proxy, systemd-resolve, cupsd,
      tailscaled, teamviewerd, gnome-remote-desktop, python3.

    Settled means: at least one line, no hole, and the table came from THIS
    machine — `reads_this_machine()`, which is round 5's network-namespace
    question plus the mount namespace and the backend's config directory. The
    ports are then COMPLETE — every SSH daemon on the box is among them — which
    is what the guard needs, since it allows exactly these and blocks
    everything else.

    The namespace half is round 5's, and it is the answer to blocker 3: "at
    least one line and no hole" is satisfiable by ONE placed listener. Measured
    on m910q, 2026-09-04, inside `sudo unshare --net` with a single root-owned
    `python3 -m http.server` and no sshd: 1 line, named, placed as not-SSH,
    `(set(), True)` — and the ufw plan emitted `ufw allow 3724/tcp`, `ufw allow
    8085/tcp`, `ufw --force enable` with `refusals=0` and `warnings=0`, on a
    host with sshd on 22 whose `/etc/ufw` that namespace writes. An empty table
    was already unresolved (round 4); a table that resolves only because it is
    nearly empty was the same bug with one line in it. The rule that closes it
    is NOT "the table must carry an sshd" — a desktop with no sshd is ordinary,
    and refusing there costs a home user's game ports the reload that puts them
    in effect — it is asking which machine the reading is of. Two more routes
    the same measurement closed, both of which DO carry an sshd and so would
    have survived a "must find sshd" rule: an sshd of the namespace's own on
    2222 inside `unshare --net` (round 4: `({2222}, True)`, enable runs, host
    port 22 gets no allow), and the same inside `unshare --net --pid --fork
    --mount-proc`, where `/proc/1` is the namespace's own init.

    This is the fifth rule to stand here. Round 3's — "settled only when every
    named owner was sshd's", written for the socket-front case — was measured
    as root on m910q and on yulon-ubuntu on 2026-09-04: 15 lines, 15 named,
    sshd on 22, and docker-proxy (3724/8085/3306), systemd-resolve
    (127.0.0.53:53), cupsd, tailscaled and teamviewerd each made the table
    "unplaced" — `({22}, False)`, the default firewalld plan's reload refused
    and port 22 dropped with it. The server this feature exists for always has
    docker-proxy or a worldserver on 3724/8085, and every Ubuntu has resolved's
    stub, so that rule refused on every box it could run on. Same two tables
    under this rule: `({22}, True)`, 22 written before the reload.

    What the first three rounds settled still holds (each refuted a rule):

    * "did any line carry an owner" — on m910q the only owned line was GNOME's
      RDP listener, this user's socket, and sshd's two lines were ownerless;
    * "is my euid 0" — root in a PID namespace reads the host's whole network
      namespace and can name none of it;
    * "`unnamed` refuses" — only in a helper the empty-`ports` branch called
      and the `ports` branch did not. `sudo unshare --pid --fork --mount-proc`
      with a transient sshd of the namespace's own on 127.0.0.1:2222 (m910q,
      2026-09-04): 16 lines, 1 named, 15 UNNAMED, `0.0.0.0:22` among them —
      `({2222}, True)` and `ufw --force enable` under a warning that 2222 kept
      the machine reachable, while port 22, where the operator was, got no
      allow. Same table, round 3 and this rule: `({2222}, False)`, refused.

    And the EMPTY table, which rounds 1–3 called the one empty answer that
    settles anything — "`ss` lists every socket in the namespace whatever the
    uid, so nothing is listening". True of the namespace, and the namespace is
    the wrong thing to be true of. Inside `sudo unshare --net` on m910q,
    2026-09-04: `ss` returned 0 with no lines, the ufw plan emitted `ufw
    --force enable` with no refusal, `systemctl is-active ssh` from the same
    shell said `active`, and `firewall-cmd --reload` from there reached the
    host's daemon over the still-shared D-Bus and dropped its runtime allows.
    `/etc/ufw` and `/etc/firewalld` are the host's, so an enable written from
    an empty namespace is the host's next-boot policy. The one machine with
    genuinely no listener loses a refusal that names two commands.

    warned on `len(zones) > 1`, and Docker — which every Yu'lon Linux install
    requires — creates a firewalld zone named `docker` bound to `docker0` on
    every box it runs on. Measured 2026-09-05, firewalld 2.2.3 in a fedora:41
    container on m910q with a `docker` zone bound to a `docker0` link and eth0
    bound to `FedoraWorkstation`: the round-6 plan read zones
    `('FedoraWorkstation', 'docker', 'public')` and warned "the game ports
    (3724, 8085) are allowed in `FedoraWorkstation`, `docker`, `public` — every
    zone this machine binds, including any of them that faces the internet", on
    a healthy single-NIC box, handing the user a `--remove-port` for a zone
    Docker owns. The same shape is in round 6's own clean run on yulon-fedora,
    which read `('FedoraWorkstation', 'docker')` with refusals 0.

    A zone qualifies only when it binds at least one interface, binds NO
    source, and every interface it binds is one of
    `_CONTAINER_BRIDGE_INTERFACES`. A source is an address range — remote
    machines by definition — and a zone carrying one is never this machine's
    own bridge, whatever else is in it.

    Takes several listings because the permanent and the runtime one can bind
    different interfaces, and a zone has to look machine-made in every reading
    that BINDS it to count: one real NIC in any listing disqualifies the zone,
    however machine-made the other listing makes it look.

    A reading that binds NOTHING — no interfaces and no sources — is no
    information, and is dropped before that vote rather than counted as a
    disagreement. Round 7 counted it, and that is what made this whole gate
    inert on a real box. Measured by me on yulon-fedora (Fedora 44, firewalld
    2.4.0, Docker 29.7.2 build 1.fc44), 2026-09-05: real Docker binds its
    bridges at RUNTIME only —

        sudo firewall-cmd --get-zone-of-interface=docker0              docker
        sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --get-zone-of-interface=docker0  no zone

    — so `firewall-cmd --permanent --list-all-zones`, which names all fifteen
    zones on that box, names `docker` with `interfaces:` and `sources:` both
    empty, while `firewall-cmd --get-active-zones` names it bound to
    `br-2ec281b6c57a br-85289dddc52d br-db9be8196055 br-eebe26d3f624 docker0`.
    Round 7 required every naming listing to look machine-made, the permanent
    one bound nothing, so `machine_made` came out `()` on that box and the
    breadth sentence named `docker` anyway. Dropping the empty reading is what
    makes this docstring's own promise reachable: a zone the permanent listing
    only NAMES is judged on the listing that binds it.

    A zone whose every reading binds nothing stays out without a vote being
    taken on it, which on that box is the case of the thirteen zones of fifteen
    that neither listing binds. It is NOT the default zone's case, and round
    8's docstring said it was: measured on m910q on 2026-09-05, feeding that box's own two
    listings to this function, `machine_made_zones(permanent)` is `()` — in the
    permanent listing alone nothing binds anything — but the active listing
    binds `FedoraWorkstation` to `eth0`, so on the reading
    `detect_firewalld_zones()` actually builds, out of both,
    `machine_made_zones(permanent, active)` is `('docker',)` and the default
    zone was voted on and lost. What keeps it out is the rule two paragraphs

    `write` is the answer the command builders use — every zone a port has to
    be allowed in. It is the UNION of the permanent bindings and the runtime
    ones rather than a choice between them, because which of the two survives
    a reload is itself a setting (`flush_all_on_reload`) and the union is
    correct under both values of it. Measured, same container and day:

    So with `yes` the permanent binding decides and a rule written only to the
    runtime zone is lost; with `no` the runtime binding decides and a rule
    written only to the permanent zone is not where the traffic is. Writing an
    extra `--add-port` into a zone nothing is bound to costs one rule that
    matches no packet; getting the choice wrong costs the session. The union is
    the cheap side of that trade.

    `permanent` and `runtime` are kept separately because their DISAGREEMENT is
    a fact the user is entitled to: it means an interface was moved at runtime
    and the reload this plan is about to run will move it back.

    level down, and round 5 had only the first of them. The daemon's live
    default zone is what every `firewall-cmd` listing tags `(default)`;
    `DefaultZone` in `/etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf` is what a reload installs.
    They diverge — `firewall-offline-cmd --set-default-zone` does it in one
    supported call — and when they do, every zone reading agrees, nothing is
    "moved at runtime", and the reload moves every unbound interface into a
    zone no rule was written to (`_FIREWALLD_DEFAULT_ZONE`). So the configured

    """Every zone a port must be written to, or None when that could not be read.

    Asked because a `--permanent --add-port` with no `--zone` writes the
    DEFAULT zone, and the default zone is not where the traffic is on a box
    whose admin bound the interface elsewhere. Measured on firewalld 2.2.3
    (fedora:41 on m910q, 2026-09-04), from a real ssh session across the
    docker bridge: eth0 in `internal`, sshd on 2222 kept alive by a
    runtime-only `--zone=internal --add-port=2222/tcp`; the round-3 plan
    resolved the route on 2222, wrote `--permanent --add-port=2222/tcp` and
    `--reload`, and afterwards `internal` listed no ports, `public` listed
    2222/3724/8085, and ssh answered "No route to host".

    Round 4 fixed that by writing to every zone `--get-active-zones` listed,
    and `--get-active-zones` is the RUNTIME binding — the one the reload
    restores over. The measurement that refuted it is in
    `_FIREWALLD_PERMANENT_ZONES_ARGV`: the same box, the same three ports, all
    six writes succeeding, `refusals=0`, and the session dead anyway because
    eth0 went back to a zone none of them named. So a running daemon is asked
    BOTH questions and the answers are kept apart (`FirewalldZoning`).

    The tool follows the daemon's state for the same reason
    `_offline_firewalld()` exists: `firewall-cmd` cannot reach a stopped
    daemon (rc 252/36), and the offline tool reads the files a stopped daemon
    will load. A stopped daemon has no runtime binding to disagree with, so it
    is asked once.

    Round 5 asked the running daemon for both of its zone lists and read
    firewalld.conf for `FlushAllOnReload`, and still wrote to a list the reload
    would abandon: the `(default)` tag on every `firewall-cmd` listing is the
    DAEMON's default zone, and the reload installs the file's `DefaultZone`.
    That divergence is round 6's blocker and is measured in
    `_FIREWALLD_DEFAULT_ZONE`; the configured default is read from the file
    already being read, cross-checked against `firewall-offline-cmd
    --list-all-zones` when the file carries no such line, and added to `write`.

    None is returned when the PERMANENT bindings could not be read, whatever
    the runtime answer was, because a `--permanent` write followed by a
    `--reload` is judged by them. The caller's answer to None is a refusal of
    anything that can lock the machine, and a warning that the ports went to
    the default zone. A running daemon whose CONFIGURED default zone could not
    be read is not None — the zones that are known are still where the ports
    have to go — but `configured_default_zone` stays None and the caller
    refuses the reload on it (see `_default_zone_refusal()`).

    round 7's answer to a review that could only reach it through `plan()`.
    Every earlier round's guard was a branch inside `_guard_the_way_back_in()`
    that also edited the command list, so a test that wanted the DECISION had to
    build a plan, and the two states that have cost this bug the most — the
    daemon's default zone against the file's, and a second zone that is only
    Docker's — could not be varied one at a time. They can now:
    `dataclasses.replace(question, zoning=...)`.

    The order of the tests is the order of what is unknown, and each returns the
    sentence for its own gap:

    * nothing at risk — the table settled, no SSH daemon on it, no
      `SSH_CONNECTION`. There is no way in to preserve, so the guide's commands
      run and a machine that is fine is told nothing. An EMPTY table does not
      reach here: `_sshd_listening_ports()` reports it unsettled.
    * no SSH route — no port, or a table that did not settle.
      `listeners_readable` is read on BOTH sides of that test: a port from
      `SSH_CONNECTION` is proof of ONE way in and no evidence it is the only
      one.
    * the zones could not be read (firewalld only) — a `--permanent` write with
      no `--zone` goes to the default zone, and the default zone is not where
      the traffic is on a box whose admin bound the interface elsewhere.
    * `DefaultZone` could not be read on a daemon that is not stopped — every
      `firewall-cmd` listing tags the DAEMON's default, and the reload installs
      the file's.
    * otherwise ALLOW, with the SSH ports the caller must write first.

    The refusal always names a remedy: the sentences come from `_ssh_refusal()`,
    `_zone_refusal()` and `_default_zone_refusal()`, and each ends with the
    commands that do by hand what was refused.

    """firewalld wrote the game ports to more than one zone the machine did not make.

    DEFECT 2 of round 6's review, and the decision it is closed with.
    `FirewalldZoning.write` is every zone this machine binds, so on a multi-homed
    box the game ports land in the WAN-facing zone as well as the LAN one.
    Measured on 2026-09-05 (firewalld 2.2.3, fedora:41 on m910q) with eth1 bound
    to a custom `wanzone` that allowed nothing: 6 permanent writes plus the
    reload, apply 7/7, refusals 0, warnings 0, `wanzone` afterwards listing
    2222, 3724 and 8085 — and the word `wanzone` appearing nowhere in the plan.

    The narrowing was rejected, twice measured: ports written only to the
    default zone were unreachable on a box whose interface was bound to
    `internal` (round 3, 2026-09-04), and in `internet` mode the zone the
    clients arrive on IS the WAN-facing one, so "LAN zones only" breaks the mode
    this feature exists for. A port opened in one zone too many is one line to
    take back; a game port in no zone at all is a feature that does not work and
    says nothing. What was wrong was not the breadth, it was that the breadth
    was silent — so the zones are named here, with the command that removes one.

    What round 6 got wrong is the GATE. It warned on `len(zones) > 1`, and
    Docker — required by every Yu'lon Linux install — creates a `docker` zone
    bound to `docker0`, so on any Linux box with Docker the count is two on a
    healthy single-NIC machine. The gate is now the zones this machine did NOT
    make for its own containers (`machine_made_zones()`); one of those is no
    breadth, and "a machine that is fine is told nothing" survives.

    Round 7 wrote that gate and did not close the defect, which is worth
    keeping here because the failure was in the STAND-IN, not the rule. It was
    checked in a fedora:41 container whose `docker` zone had been bound with
    `firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=docker --add-interface=docker0` — a
    permanent binding real Docker never makes. Measured by me with real
    subprocesses on yulon-fedora (Fedora 44, firewalld 2.4.0, Docker 29.7.2
    build 1.fc44) on 2026-09-05, round 7's module at efc6d83f:

        detect_firewalld_zones('running')  machine_made ()
        decide_lockout(...)                ssh-preserved, allowed, notes 1
        the note                           "…allowed in `FedoraWorkstation`,
                                           `docker` — every zone this machine

    The same call after round 8's fix, same box, same minute's readings:
    `machine_made ('docker',)`, `notes 0`. What was wrong is recorded in
    `machine_made_zones()`: real Docker binds its bridges at runtime only, and
    round 7 let the permanent listing's empty reading vote.

    And it says WRITTEN, not "allowed", unless the plan is about to put them in
    effect. Measured 2026-09-05 in a fedora:41 container with the daemon
    stopped: eight `firewall-offline-cmd --add-port` writes, no reload, the
    enable withheld — and round 6 still said the ports "are allowed in `dmz`,
    `public`, `trusted`, `wanzone`". Nothing was: the rules load when firewalld
    starts. The same wording stood on every refusal that strips the reload.

    """Make `commands` safe to run on a box whose only route in is SSH.

    Returns `(commands, ssh_ports, refusals, warnings)`, where `ssh_ports` are
    the ports opened solely to keep SSH reachable — `apply()` needs them by
    number so it can check the rules ARRIVED before it runs anything that could
    cut them.

    Two kinds of command can cut them (`_can_lock_out()`), and they are decided
    in two steps because they are asked for differently:

    **The enable is opt-in, on both backends.** `ufw allow` takes effect
    immediately on an active ufw and is staged on an inactive one, so the rules
    the user asked for land either way and `ufw enable` is never needed for the
    request. On firewalld the same conclusion is reached from different facts,
    and reaching it by analogy was the bug: with the daemon DOWN,
    `firewall-cmd --permanent` cannot stage anything at all, so the request is
    served by `firewall-offline-cmd` (chosen in `_firewalld_port_commands()`)
    and the start is still not needed; with the daemon UP the ports go straight
    in and the start would change nothing about what is enforced. What either
    command does do is change the machine's security posture — and, on the
    headless server this feature exists for, end the operator's session. A step
    should not run a command that cannot advance its goal and can destroy
    access. So the default withholds it and says so, and `enable_firewall=True`
    is the path for a caller that really is asking to turn a firewall on. (No
    caller passes it yet — see the module docstring.)

    **A firewalld that is already RUNNING is told nothing about its start.**
    Withholding `systemctl enable --now firewalld` there is not a refusal a
    person can act on: the policy that command would bring up is already in
    effect, so "firewalld is left as you had it, to turn it on yourself…"
    arrives on a machine whose firewall is on and reads as advice to do what has
    been done. The one thing the withheld `enable` would still have changed is
    boot persistence, a posture decision this module does not make for anybody.
    So the start is dropped silently. What that sentence used to say was "no
    refusal, warning or ssh guard is produced", and the early return that
    implemented it left BEFORE the route was consulted, which routed the reload
    around the guard (below). It no longer returns early.

    **The reload is part of the request, and it is the same lockout.** It is
    kept for a running or unreadable daemon (`_firewalld_port_commands()`),
    the ports are not enforced without it, and it drops every runtime-only
    rule — including the one an admin used to keep a moved sshd alive.
    Measured with the shipped code on 2026-09-04 (firewalld 2.2.3, fedora:41
    on m910q): with `route=SshRoute(connected=True, ports=(2222,),
    listeners_readable=True)` the running-daemon plan was `--permanent 3724,
    --permanent 8085, --reload` with `ssh_ports=()`, no refusal and no warning,
    while the `unknown`-daemon plan for the same route wrote `--permanent 2222`
    first — the function wrote the SSH rule when it was LESS certain of the
    daemon and stopped when it was certain. And run for real, a 9999 kept open
    by a runtime-only allow went from curl 200 to curl 000 across that reload.
    So the reload gets exactly the enable's treatment, on the same reading of
    the same route, and NOT behind `enable_firewall`: the production path never
    passes it, and this is the production path.

    **Whichever of the two is in the list, SSH is preserved or it is refused.**
    Never a bare `ufw allow 22/tcp`: sshd may be anywhere, so the port comes
    from `SshRoute` — the running system. A port is not enough on its own,
    either: `SSH_CONNECTION` names ONE way in and is no evidence that it is the
    only one, so an unread socket table refuses even when the environment
    supplied a port. If nothing can be established the command is dropped,
    because refusing costs the user nothing they had a second ago and running
    it wrongly costs them the machine. When the route IS resolved, the allow
    goes in before the FIRST command that could cut it, and `ssh_ports` carries
    the ports so `apply()` can prove the allow landed.

    **On firewalld, "written" means written to every zone in use, or it is
    refused.** Round 3's version of the paragraph above ended "a resolved-and-
    written reload on a running daemon says nothing: the machine is fine".
    Measured on 2026-09-04 (firewalld 2.2.3, fedora:41 on m910q, from a real
    ssh session across the docker bridge): eth0 bound to `internal`, sshd on
    2222 kept alive by a runtime-only allow in that zone, route resolved on
    2222 from the container's own `ss` — the plan wrote `--permanent
    --add-port=2222/tcp` (no `--zone`, i.e. `public`) and `--reload`, said
    nothing, and ssh went from rc 0 to "No route to host"; `internal` listed
    no ports afterwards and `public` listed all three. The machine was not
    fine; the rule had been written somewhere the traffic never went. So the
    SSH rule is spelled once per zone from `detect_firewalld_zones()`, and when
    the zones could not be read the lockout commands are dropped with a
    refusal that says how to read them — a reload on an unknown zone layout is
    the same coin-toss with a paper trail.

    **And "every zone in use" includes the one the reload is about to create.**
    Round 5's three zone readings all take their `(default)` tag from the
    running daemon, and the reload installs `DefaultZone` from
    `/etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf`. `zoning` carries both, so the write list
    already contains the configured default (`FirewalldZoning.write`); what is
    decided here is the case where it could NOT be read on a running daemon,
    which is the one state in which the divergence cannot be ruled out. The
    reload is refused by name then, exactly as it is when the zones themselves
    are unreadable — see `_default_zone_refusal()` and the measurement in
    `_FIREWALLD_DEFAULT_ZONE`, where apply ran 4/4 with 0 refusals and 0
    warnings and ssh answered "No route to host" afterwards.

    firewalld used to be exempt from all of this on the grounds that its
    `public` zone ships `ssh` allowed. That grounds was false — the shipped
    service is 22/tcp only — and the exemption is gone; see
    `_starts_firewalld()` and `firewalld_start_withheld()`.

    """Compute the plan for `mode`. Detection seams default to the real platform probes.

    `enable_firewall` is the one knob that can turn a firewall ON, and it is off
    by default — see `_guard_the_way_back_in()` for the argument. A caller that
    passes True gets the enable only if SSH survives it, and `detect_ssh` is the
    seam that decides. It is consulted when an enable is asked for, and when
    the command list reloads firewalld — which a firewalld plan that WANTS the
    firewall (`wants_firewall` below: every mode except `loopback`) does against
    a running or unreadable daemon, `enable_firewall` or not. So an ordinary ufw
    plan spawns no probe and asks the environment nothing, and an ordinary
    firewalld `lan` or `internet` plan asks the machine about SSH before it
    reloads; the sentence that used to stand here said "ONLY when an enable is
    on the table", and that is the wording under which the reload ran unguarded.

    `detect_firewalld` is consulted on every firewalld plan that wants the
    firewall, including the default one, because it decides which tool writes
    the ports the user actually asked for. A plan that skipped it opened none of
    them (see `detect_firewalld_daemon()`). `detect_zones` is consulted on those
    same plans for the same reason one step later: it decides WHERE the ports
    are written, and a plan that never asked wrote them to a zone the interface
    was not in (see `detect_firewalld_zones()`).

    A `loopback` plan reaches none of that. Measured on m910q 2026-09-06 at
    `92cacc44` from a fresh `git clone --shared`, with seams that record every
    call (`pyplan/gates/bug41-loopback-2026-09-05/mutations-round4.txt`, the
    UNMUTATED block, lines 30-38):

        UNMUTATED firewalld loopback: seams=[] fw=[] manual=[] warnings=1
        UNMUTATED firewalld lan: seams=['detect_firewalld', 'detect_zones']
            fw=['firewall-offline-cmd --add-port=3724/tcp',
            'firewall-offline-cmd --add-port=8085/tcp'] manual=[] warnings=2
        UNMUTATED alf loopback: detect_alf called=False firewall_state=None
        UNMUTATED netsh loopback: manual=[]

    (the `lan` lines wrapped here; the file has each on one line).

    `elevate` says whether the WRITES this plan describes will run elevated,
    and every default detection seam then asks the machine with that same
    authority (`probe_prefix()`). It defaults to True because `apply()`'s own
    `elevate` does and because the one production caller —
    `ui/controller_view.py:320`, `network_plan=lambda mode: networking.plan(...)`
    paired one line later with `network_apply=lambda plan:
    networking.apply(plan, sql=sql)` — passes neither, so the two would
    otherwise disagree by default: the plan would read as uid 1000 and the
    writes would run as root. Measured with round-4's code, which had no such
    knob: on m910q and on yulon-ubuntu that mismatch refused every enable and
    every reload the app could ever produce (`probe_prefix()`). A caller that
    will apply WITHOUT elevation must pass `elevate=False` here, and then the
    plan refuses rather than claiming a reading its writes will not have; the
    mismatch is caught in `apply()` as well, from `NetworkPlan.probed_elevated`.

    The three detection seams default to None rather than to the probe
    functions themselves, because the real default is a probe BOUND to that
    authority and a bare function reference cannot carry it. Passing any of
    them replaces both the probe and its authority, which is what a test wants.

    Linux firewall commands run under `sudo -n` (non-interactive): if sudo
    needs a password the step is SKIPPED with the exact command to paste, never
    blocked on an invisible prompt. The realmlist UPDATE needs a `SqlRunner`
    for the server's auth DB; without one it is skipped and reported.

    Anything the plan REFUSED to do arrives here already decided, and is copied
    into `skipped` as well as `refusals`: a reader that only knows about
    `skipped` — which is what the gate that found bug-checklist §39 read — must
    not see an empty list while a command from the block went unrun.

    `elevate` is the other half of `plan(elevate=...)` and the two have to
    agree. When the plan says it read the machine with a prefix
    (`NetworkPlan.probed_elevated`) and this call will not use one, every
    command that could cut the session is refused by name — see the loop.

    `server_dir` is where the applied mode is remembered (`INTENT_FILE`), and
    it is remembered ONLY once the realmlist UPDATE has actually gone through.
    Recording it any earlier — when the plan was shown, or before the statement
    was sent — would leave `catalog.native`'s closing realm step honouring a
    choice the database never received: a server whose Apply failed would go on
    advertising a reachable address while a file said its owner had chosen the
    loopback, and every later resume would leave that disagreement alone.
    Defaulted to None, which records nothing, because every caller that only
    wants the firewall half of a plan (and every test that predates §41) passes
    no directory.
