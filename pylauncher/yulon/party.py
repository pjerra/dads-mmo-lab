"""My Party's server-side bridge: deploy it, then ask whether it arrived (8.6).

## The route, and why it needs a bridge at all

`.playerbots bot addclass <class>` builds the party. It is declared
`SEC_PLAYER, Console::No` (`mod-playerbots PlayerbotCommandScript.cpp:36`, read
on `yulon-ubuntu` 2026-09-08 at `b949b50b`), and AzerothCore filters its command
table by `IsInvokerVisible(handler)` before it walks it. So a console or SOAP
caller cannot see the subcommand, never mind run it — asked over SOAP that day,
`playerbots bot addclass mage` came back with a USAGE list naming only the four
`Console::Yes` siblings. It also resolves its master from a **live session**, so
there is no console spelling of it waiting to be found.

The route that remains is a Lua script inside the world process: ALE's
`PLAYER_EVENT_ON_COMMAND` hook hands a script every command string, including
the ones the command table refused, and `Player:RunCommand` runs the playerbot
command **as that player**, in the session it needs. That is the project's own
bridge, and the scripts under `pylauncher/lua/party/` are it.

## Why this module is mostly about proving the bridge is there

Deploying the scripts is a directory copy and it always works. Whether the
server ever READS them has four independent ways to be false, and on
2026-08-20 one of them was: the deploy reported success and every bridge command
answered *"Command does not exist"*. That failure is the reason this box exists,
so the shape of this module is: gather facts, say which precondition is unmet in
its own words, and prove arrival **by the script answering** rather than by the
copy succeeding.

The four ways, each with its own sentence in `preconditions()`:

1. **The Lua engine is not compiled into the image.** A conf file cannot see
   this and neither can a module marker — `modules/mod-ale` can be cloned and
   the running binary still have no Lua in it, because the module is C++ and
   arrives at a rebuild. Read from the binary (`read_engine_in_binary`).
2. **`ALE.Enabled` is off.** Its compiled default is `false`
   (`ALE src/LuaEngine/ALEConfig.cpp:20`) while the shipped conf's own comment
   says `true` — the code wins, so a conf that never sets the key runs no
   scripts at all.
3. **`ALE.ScriptPath` points elsewhere.** It ships as `"lua_scripts"`, relative,
   resolved against the worldserver's cwd where nothing is. This is the
   2026-08-20 bug by name (`rust-main:crates/dml-wow/src/bridge.rs:189-195`).
4. **The world has not restarted since the copy.** ALE reads the directory when
   the engine starts, which is why `deploy()` reports `changed`.

## What this module deliberately does not do

It does not write `mod_ale.conf`. The Rust launcher's `ensure_ale_conf` did, and
it was right for a launcher whose installer created that file; here the file
belongs to `mod-ale.json`, and two writers with different ideas of a working
conf is exactly the drift `style-guide` §4 forbids. The manifest was corrected
instead — it named `ALE.EnableLuaEngine`, a key that appears in neither the
module's `conf/mod_ale.conf.dist` nor its `ALEConfig.cpp`.

    * **The conf IS the accepted list.** `PlayerbotAIConfig.cpp:487-493` loads
      `AiPlayerbot.PremadeSpecName.<class>.<specno>` and `SpecPick` compares the
      whispered text to those values with `==`
      (`ChangeTalentsAction.cpp:144`). A list kept by hand in this app could only
      ever drift from it, and the drift is invisible: a name the module does not
      have is answered `Spec <x> not found` in the GAME window
      (`:157`, through `TellMasterNoFacing`), so nothing comes back over the
      channel and a wrong spec looks exactly like a right one.
    * **A gap ends the class.** `SpecPick` walks specno upwards from 0 and
      **breaks** at the first empty name (`:138-142`), so a conf that defines
      8.0, 8.1 and 8.3 has an unreachable 8.3 whatever it says. Only the
      contiguous run from 0 is returned — offering the rest would be offering
      names this server cannot be made to take.

    Column 0 only, which is `read_conf`'s rule for `read_conf`'s reason: the
    shipped file carries commented keys and a pattern that matched them would
    read the file's prose as its settings.

    **A value is taken verbatim to the end of the line, `#` included**, and
    whether the core's own reader would drop a trailing comment is NOT measured
    on this tree — so `… = arcane pve # the good one` is read here as the whole
    string, which is very probably not what the module has. What that costs is
    bounded, and it is bounded the safe way round: `#` is outside `SPEC_SHAPE`,
    so `InstallParty.specs` filters such a name out and the picker never offers
    it. The result of the unmeasured case is a spec missing from the list, not a
    spec offered that the server would refuse in the game window where nothing
    can hear it. Measuring `sConfigMgr`'s comment handling is what would let this

    level-1 build on a level-60 bot; and `autogear` follows the spec because gear

    the reading T5 left behind rather than adding to it. On a bot freshly joined
    to a master's party, the level sent at +0, +5, +10, +20 and +30 seconds
    after the group row appeared LANDED every time and stayed landed: the
    world's own `.pinfo` read the chosen level within a second of the send and
    never stopped reading it — ninety seconds later in the three rows whose tail
    ran that long, fifteen to forty-six in the other four. There is no window.
    What T5 photographed is
    `characters.level` not having been written: `.character level` on an ONLINE
    character calls `GiveLevel` and writes no row
    (`cs_character.cpp:252-281`), and a character writes its own row at
    `PlayerSaveInterval` — a quarter of an hour here — so the panel's readback
    a second later was reading the last save and reporting it as the level.

    So what closes the window is not a wait for the module and not a resend: it
    is a SAVE, which is what `SAVE_COMMAND`'s docstring cites and what
    `_saved_row_level` sends. The row is then a reading of this press.

    **The resend is what a real disagreement earns, and only that.** Once the
    row has been written, a row that still disagrees is the world disagreeing —
    the case the ticket was filed for — and that one gets the level sent a
    second time and the row written and read again. A resend before the save
    would fire on every press, on a row that had simply not been written yet,
    and prove nothing; this never does it.

    The order — send, save, read, resend, save, read — is also why the first
    reading is not skipped: a bot the server already made at the level that was
    asked for needs no save and no resend, and `add_bot` says so in

    folding a failure into `()` is correct there. This poll watches for a guid
    to VANISH, so `()` cannot mean both "the row is gone" and "the row could
    not be read" — round 2 of T13 closed the one route that made a failed
    read look like silence (the Lua no longer answers an empty SOAP reply),
    so what is left on a failed read here is a genuine uninvite whose
    follow-up read errored, and folding it to `()` would report `removed`
    on a read that never happened. A failed read here neither confirms nor
    denies, so it keeps the poll going the same as an unchanged row would;
    only the LAST read decides what expiry reports.

    The order is the module's own (`PlayerbotMgr.cpp`, and §6's transcription of

    say:

    1. **The master's own row is dropped**, `:1314`. Before the online arm and
       not after it: the master is necessarily in the world, so an online-first
       order would grey his own name in his own picker and explain it with a
       rule that is not the reason.
    2. **Online is refused**, `:685-686` -- before any permission rule, so a
       character on the master's own account is refused too while it is logged
       in.
    3. **The four rules in the module's own order**: own account, guild mate,
       addclass pool, linked account (`:101-116`). The first that answers is the
       one the row names; a row that reaches none of them is greyed with all
       four named.
    **Three of those four arms are gated on a conf key** and the gate is INSIDE
    the arm, not in front of the loop -- round 1's first finding, and the shape
    is the module's own: `sameAccount`, `sameGuild` and `linkedAccount` are each
    `allow<X>Bots && <the membership test>`, and the four are then OR'd
    (`:101-116`). So a character on the master's own account with
    `AllowAccountBots = 0` is not refused outright: it falls through and the
    addclass pool or a link may still let it in, exactly as the module lets it.
    A row that reaches no arm says WHICH gate stopped it where one did --
    "on this character's own account, but this server's
    AiPlayerbot.AllowAccountBots is 0" is a different thing to fix from "no rule
    reached it", and an unreadable key is a third thing again: indeterminate,
    greyed, never offered.

    **The cap is not here at all** (round 1's second finding). The module counts
    `mgr->GetPlayerbotsCount() + loadingForMaster` (`:125-135`) -- bots it
    controls, plus bots loading for that account, both of them state inside the
    world process. The group table is a different number in both directions: a
    bot uninvited but still controlled counts for the module and not for the
    table, and another player's bots in a shared group count for the table and
    not for the module. So no row here is allowed or refused on a cap this app
    cannot read; `_cap_note` says so beside the list instead.

    Not `dbreads.SqlReader` widened, and not `apply.DockerSql` imported: the
    read seam is deliberately unable to reach the write half ("what is not in
    the type cannot be called through it", `dbreads.SqlReader`), and widening it
    for a link table would take that guarantee away from every read in this
    module. So the write arrives through a seam of its own, held in its own
    attribute, `None` on an install that has no route to one -- and exactly one
    function in this module holds it.

    **The method is `query` and that is round 2's change** (the lead's
    rejection, must-fix 3). The write has to be transactional and read back in
    the SAME database session -- `START TRANSACTION`, the `INSERT IGNORE`, the
    row count, the readback, `COMMIT` -- and `apply.DockerSql` runs one
    statement per `docker exec`, so the whole script goes out as one call and
    the answer comes back on its stdout. `run_statement()` discards stdout and
    could not carry the readback; `query()` is the returning runner the lead
    asked for, and structural typing means it must be spelled the way the real
    object spells it.

    **The boundary still holds**, and it is worth saying how: it is not the
    METHOD NAME that keeps this module's reads from writing, it is which object
    each of them is called on. Every picker read goes through `self._sql`, whose
    type is `dbreads.SqlReader`; nothing in this module can send a statement
    through that seam and have it write, because `DockerSql.query` is one
    statement and `SqlReader` is what the picker holds. The link script goes
    through `self._link_writer`, which is `None` unless a caller wired one, is
    used by one function, and is what the ledger's own paragraph is written
