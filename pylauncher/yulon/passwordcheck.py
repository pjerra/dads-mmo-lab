"""Is this account's stored credential the password we asked for?

The CMaNGOS trees report a successful `account set password` as a failure --
deliberately, "to avoid normal report for hide passwords" (`Level3.cpp:1178-1183`
on TBC, `:1139-1145` on Vanilla) -- so the reply cannot say what happened and the
row has to. **"The row changed" is not that answer.** Any other writer changes
the row too: a second window, an administrator at a console, a retry. A command
that was refused would then be reported as a success while the account holds
somebody else's password, and the person who asked would be locked out by the
reassurance. That was 8.3b's adversarial review, and it was right.

What answers is the verifier. SRP6 stores `g^H(s, H(USER:PASS)) mod N`, so
recomputing it from the row's own salt and the password that was asked for says
whether THAT password is the one this account now has -- whoever wrote it, and
whatever the server said.

**The recipe is measured, not read off a specification.** An account was created
through this app with a known password on the live Vanilla server (m910q,
2026-09-07), its `s` and `v` read back, and every candidate byte order computed
until one reproduced the stored verifier. Exactly one did, and the wrong password
reproduced none. A scheme that has not been through that is absent from the table
below, and this module answers `None` for it: a password change this app cannot
confirm is a smaller answer, not a wrong one.

The order is the point and the trees disagree about it: AzerothCore names its

a pair read in a table's own column order would be back to front on one of them
and would answer "no" for every correct password. `mangos_sha` has ONE column
and no salt at all, which is why this is a tuple rather than a pair.

`azerothcore` is deliberately absent, and so is any scheme nobody has created a
known-password account under and read back: that tree answers its own commands
properly, so nothing there needs a row believed, and a recipe nobody has run

    not log in" -- so a core that changed how it stores credentials, or a query
    that came back truncated, would turn every successful password change into
