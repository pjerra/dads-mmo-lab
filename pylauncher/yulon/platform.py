# ------------------------------------------------------- the macOS firewall
# macOS's firewall is a different KIND of thing, and the difference decides the
# whole design: the Application Firewall is per-APPLICATION, not per-port. Its
# configuration profile schema has no port or protocol key at all, so "open TCP
# 3724" cannot be expressed. The layer that could express it is `pf`, which
# Apple documents as not-API (TN3165) and which no third-party app should be
# editing. And every mutation of either needs root, which the macOS install
# path deliberately does not have.
#
# Then the part that settles it: the binary the firewall evaluates for a
# published container port is **Docker Desktop's**, not ours. The server
# listens inside Docker's Linux VM; what accepts a LAN player's connection on
# the host is `com.docker.backend`. Allow-listing Yu'lon would be theatre.
#
# So `firewall_commands("alf", ...)` returning `[]` is the correct answer, not
# a gap, and what macOS needs instead is an honest read of the state. Every
# claim in this section is inherited from documentation rather than measured —
# nobody on this project has a Mac — and `pyplan/checklist.md` carries the list
# of checks that settle each one.

Six values rather than a bool because the five ways of *not* joining are not

they said yes and the `usermod` that followed did not run. Only `granted` and
`already-member` mean the user can drive Docker afterwards, and only those two
may print the log-out-and-back-in line.

`join-failed` was the sixth, added late. The field used to carry the CONSENT
answer, so a yes whose `usermod` was refused for want of a sudo ticket was
recorded as `granted` — a support JSON saying the user is in the docker group
when they are not, which is precisely the "a way of not joining reads as
joining" failure the five values existed to prevent, reintroduced one layer up.
The manual steps had always drawn the distinction; only the machine-readable

    On Linux this is exactly `("docker",)` and nothing else runs: PATH means
    the same thing to a running process as it does to the shell that started it,
    so `shutil.which` is correct and sufficient there.

    macOS is the Windows case with a different mechanism. A `.app` opened from
    Finder is a child of launchd, not of any shell, and launchd's PATH is
    `/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin` - `/usr/local/bin`, where Docker Desktop
    symlinks its CLI, is not on it. The first Mac to run a release (2026-08-25)
    had Docker Desktop installed and running, and the install still spent 180
    seconds polling a `docker` that raised `FileNotFoundError` on every try,
    then failed with "Docker isn't available". `_macos_docker_programs()`.

    On Windows it is not, and the gap is structural rather than unlucky. A
    process inherits its environment at creation and Windows never updates a
    live process's copy, so the launcher that just ran Docker Desktop's silent
    installer cannot see the PATH entry that installer wrote. Reproduced in one
    process (2026-08-23): with the engine fully up, stripping the docker
    directory out of `os.environ["PATH"]` makes `shutil.which("docker")` return
    None; resolving against the registry's PATH in the same breath still returns
    `...\\DockerDesktop\\resources\\bin\\docker.EXE`.

    What that cost the user: `ensure_docker()` would install Docker Desktop,
    start it, watch it come up, poll `docker info` for the full 180 seconds
    without ever finding the binary, and finish with "Docker Desktop was
    installed but its engine has not answered yet — open Docker Desktop, wait
    for 'Engine running', then try again". The engine WAS running. Restarting
    the launcher was the only way through, so a first run could not finish
    unattended no matter what else was fixed.

    The registry is asked before the hardcoded install directories, inverting
    the obvious order, because the registry is what the installer actually
    wrote: it is right for a custom `--installdir` and right for whatever
    layout the next Docker Desktop ships, while the hardcoded list was measured
    wrong on the only real machine available (see `_windows_docker_bins()`).
    Both cost microseconds next to the process spawn they precede.

    Nothing is cached. The value is meant to change underneath us — that is the
    entire point — so `_wait_docker_ready()`'s poll re-asks every few seconds
    and picks up the PATH entry the installer writes mid-wait.

    `docker_programs()` answers "everything worth trying"; a command line needs
    exactly one, so this picks the first candidate `shutil.which` can resolve.
    That is the same evidence `_windows_docker_programs()` already trusts — it
    only ever offers a path it found through `_which` or confirmed with
    `is_file()` — so nothing new is being believed here, and for the bare name
    `docker` it is the only test available short of spawning a process.

    `None` is a real answer, not a failure to compute one: this host has no
    docker CLI. Callers turn it into their own error carrying
    `DOCKER_CLI_MISSING_HELP`, which is the whole reason the return type is
    optional rather than a hopeful `"docker"` that guarantees a
    `FileNotFoundError` two lines later.

    **A hit is cached; a miss never is**, and that asymmetry is the design.
    Measured on this Windows 11 box (2026-08-23, 200 iterations each):
    `docker_programs()` costs 7.5ms when docker is on the live PATH — a full
    PATHEXT walk of a 988-character PATH — and 14.7ms when it is not, because
    that is the run that reads both registry hives and stats the fallback
    directories, and it logs an INFO line every single time. One `docker
    inspect` costs 308ms, so the resolution is 2-5% of a command; but
    `wait_ready()` issues five docker commands per poll, polls every 2s, and
    runs for up to 480s — 1200 commands, i.e. ~18s of pure PATH scanning and
    1200 identical log lines for one server start. Resolving once removes both.

    Not caching the miss is what keeps the caching honest, because "no docker
    yet" is precisely the state `ensure_docker()` exists to end. A launcher
    started on a bare Windows box resolves nothing, caches nothing, and pays
    14.7ms per call for as long as that is true; the first call after the
    silent installer writes its PATH entry finds `docker.exe` in a hive this
    process never re-read at startup and pins it for the rest of the run. That
    is the exact sequence this whole mechanism was built for, and a cached
    `None` would have broken it.

    The case the cache does not follow is the reverse one — Docker uninstalled
    while the launcher is open — where a pinned absolute path stops resolving.
    `docker._docker()` turns the resulting `OSError` into the same "Docker
    could not be found" answer, so the user is told the truth; they are just
    told it via a path that used to work.

    `docker-credential-<store>` and its `cli-plugins` **by name, through the
    PATH of the process that started it**. A `.app` opened from Finder is a
    child of launchd, whose PATH is `/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`, so

    command, one of which a tenth would forget.

    Prepended, not appended, for the same reason the candidate was preferred

# ------------------------------------------------------------------ downloads
# The Windows/macOS provisioning paths fetch a Docker Desktop installer — 629 MB
# (659,189,680 bytes, measured 2026-08-23) — and then run it ELEVATED. So the
# transfer has to be certificate-verified, and on the box this was measured on
# the obvious way to do that does not work.
#
# Measured by hand on a fresh Windows 11 install (2026-08-22, Python 3.12.10 /
# OpenSSL 3.0.16): `urllib.request.urlopen` aborted after 0.4 s with
# `[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] unable to get local issuer certificate`, and
# the user was handed the "go download Docker Desktop yourself" step this product
# exists to remove. On the same box github.com, raw.githubusercontent.com and
# pypi.org all verified fine; only desktop.docker.com did not, and
# `ssl.get_default_verify_paths().cafile` was None with 18 CA certs in the store.
#
# Why one host and not the others: Windows ships a small root set and pulls the
# rest ON DEMAND, through the CryptoAPI automatic root update, while schannel is
# building a chain. OpenSSL — which Python's `ssl` uses — reads a SNAPSHOT of the
# same store and never triggers that fetch, so it only ever sees roots that
# already happen to be materialized. desktop.docker.com chains to Amazon RSA
# 2048 M01 -> Amazon Root CA 1, which was not among the 18; github.com chains to
# Sectigo/USERTrust, which was. (Chains re-checked from a healthy Windows box,
# 2026-08-23: 58 CA certs there, and both hosts verify.)
#
# So the fix is to give the transfer a root set that is actually complete, in
# this order:
#   1. The OS-shipped `curl` (System32 on Windows 10 1803+, /usr/bin/curl on
#      macOS/Linux), pinned by absolute path. It is built against schannel /
#      Secure Transport, i.e. the OS trust engine WITH the on-demand root fetch,
#      so it sees the roots OpenSSL cannot — and it sees an enterprise root
#      installed by a TLS-intercepting proxy, which a bundled CA file
#      structurally cannot. It also brings resume and retry for the 629 MB.
#   2. `urllib` against the OS root store WITH certifi's Mozilla bundle added on
#      top (`requirements.txt` ships certifi); the OS store alone when certifi is
#      not importable or its bundle cannot be read. In-process, portable, and the
#      backstop for a box with no curl (Windows before 1803) or a curl that will
#      not run. Keeping the OS roots in the set is what preserves the
#      enterprise-root case in step 1 for this transport too — see
#      `verify_context()`.
#
# There is no third step. Verification is never turned off here: an unverified
# download of an executable that is about to be run with elevation is a
# supply-chain hole, not a fallback. If both transports fail, the caller gets
# both errors and a manual step (`_MANUAL_ROOT_CERTS`).

    """A verifying TLS context trusting the OS root store AND certifi's — the union, not one.

    `ssl.create_default_context()` already means verify + check hostname, and on
    its own it loads the OS roots. What it cannot fix is that OpenSSL only ever
    reads a SNAPSHOT of the Windows store while Windows materializes most roots
    on demand through CryptoAPI: the fresh Windows 11 box the block above was
    written for had 18 of them and could not chain desktop.docker.com to Amazon
    Root CA 1. certifi (Mozilla's bundle) carries the ones that are missing.

    Correcting the first version of this function (review finding, 2026-08-23):
    it built the context as `create_default_context(cafile=certifi.where())`,
    which does not WIDEN the OS store — given a `cafile`, `create_default_context()`
    takes that arm and never calls `load_default_certs()`, so the result trusted
    certifi's roots and nothing else. Measured here: the OS store holds 58 CA
    certs, certifi 2026.07.22 holds 121, and 33 of the 58 are absent from certifi
    (DigiCert Global Root CA and Baltimore CyberTrust Root among them) — as is,
    by construction, every root an administrator installed, which is how a
    corporate TLS-inspecting proxy or an internal CA is trusted at all. Loading
    the OS store first and calling `load_verify_locations()` afterwards ADDS to
    it instead of replacing it: 154 CA certs, with both sets contained in the
    result.

    An unreadable certifi bundle degrades to the OS store rather than raising.
    Raising would turn a packaging fault — `cacert.pem` not collected into the
    PyInstaller build — into "could not determine the public IP (offline?)", the
    exact misdiagnosis the rest of this section exists to remove. The OS store
    alone still verifies every connection; it is the narrower failure, and the
    log line says which one happened.

    Nothing here relaxes verification, and there is no branch that can: every
    path returns a `create_default_context()` result with roots added to it and
    no other setting touched.

    Public, and imported by `manifest_store` and `update`, because the root-store
    gap is a fact about the OS this process runs on — the same thing `detect()`
    and `config_dir()` are about — and every HTTPS call in the app has it. Both
    of those modules already sit above this one in the import graph (this one
    imports only `runner` and `log`), so there is no cycle to create; giving the
    context its own module would only move the measurements above away from the
    `download_verified()` code they were taken for.

    Cached because assembling it is not free: measured on this dev box, 14 ms for
    the OS store alone, 193 ms for certifi alone and 211 ms for the union of the
    two. One `urlopen` per manifest file means a full refresh of the WotLK tree
    is 45 GETs, so building a context per call would have put ~9.5 s of
    certificate parsing into it. Sharing one context across connections is the
    normal way to use `ssl` — a context holds no per-connection state — and the
    root set it reads cannot change inside one run of the app.

    The start step used to be `Start-Process 'Docker Desktop'`. That string is
    neither a path nor a command: ShellExecute resolves a bare name through PATH
    and the App Paths registry, and Docker Desktop's installer registers
    neither — it only adds `...\Docker\resources\bin`, which holds the `docker`
    CLI, not the app. Measured by hand on a clean Windows 11 VM (2026-08-22):
    the step exits 1 with "The system cannot find the file specified" on ANY
    machine, installed or not. So provisioning downloaded Docker Desktop,
    installed it silently, and then never started it — the user watched a
    3-minute poll and was told "the engine has not answered yet" with a
    perfectly good install sitting on disk, and the one thing that would have
    fixed it (open Docker Desktop) was the thing the app claimed to have done.

    Hard-coding `C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\Docker Desktop.exe` in its place
    fixes one machine. It would not have fixed the machine this was written on:
    Docker Desktop 4.83.0 there is a per-user install under
    `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\DockerDesktop`, with nothing under Program Files,
    no `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Docker Inc.` key, no `App Paths` entry in either hive and
    nothing named `Docker Desktop.exe` on PATH. The single source that answered
    was the Start menu shortcut (2026-08-23).

    So Windows is asked first and the known layouts are only the fallback —
    the same order, for the same measured reason, as `docker_programs()`: what
    the machine reports is right for a custom `--installation-dir` and right for
    whatever layout the next release ships, while a hardcoded list is a guess
    that was already wrong once here. Measured cost of asking: 0.60 s, once per
    provisioning run, immediately before starting a program that then takes
    tens of seconds to bring its engine up. The list survives underneath, for
    the box whose PowerShell is locked down or missing.

    `winreg` — used a few functions up by `_registry_search_path()` — would read
    the registry in-process and is deliberately not used: the answer that
    actually worked came from a Start menu `.lnk`, which needs a `WScript.Shell`
    COM call, and PATH, which needs `Get-Command`. One PowerShell probe answers
    all three in one spawn and goes through the `run` seam every test here
    already fakes; `winreg` would answer the one source that was empty.
