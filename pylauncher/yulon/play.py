"""The reads the Characters tab is built on (8.4a).

Reads live here and writes go to the server through `yulon.commands`, which is
owner answer 7 rather than a layering choice: this app reads rows and the server
changes them.

Three of these guard a failure that does not raise, which is why each has a test
naming what it would look like:

* a character name matched in the wrong case answers "no such character" for a
  character standing in Stormwind -- this tree's `characters.name` is
  case-sensitive, and it was the prior art's own bug;
* a search pattern with a `%` in it matches every item in the game, because
  `%` and `_` are LIKE wildcards and a person typing "50% off" did not mean
  that;
* a gear-set query built for the wrong tree reads a column that means something
  else. `character_inventory.item` is the item INSTANCE guid on all four of
  these trees, and a query that selected it would answer a list of numbers that
  look exactly like item ids and are not (see `equipped`, which records what
  each of the shapes actually does on each tree, measured rather than assumed).

    The shape of the query is the catalog's, because the trees disagree about
    where the item id lives. AzerothCore's inventory row carries the item
    INSTANCE guid alone and the template id is a join away in
    `item_instance.itemEntry`; the CMaNGOS rows carry BOTH -- `item` (the
    instance guid, and the primary key) and `item_template`.

    **What each shape does where, corrected in 8.4c.** The note here said a
    query built for the wrong tree "does not fail -- it answers a list of
    guids", it was repeated in five places, and it is true of neither of the two
    shapes this catalog offers:

    * the flat shape on AzerothCore names a column that install has not got
      (`character_inventory` there is `guid, bag, slot, item` --
      `pyplan/phase8-reads/azerothcore.md:432-441`), so it is an `Unknown
      column` error and loud;
    * the joined shape on a CMaNGOS tree answers the SAME ids the flat one
      does, because `character_inventory.item` is `item_instance.guid` and
      `Player.cpp:3832` writes both from one Item -- a redundant hop, and one
      that can only drop a piece whose `item_instance` row is missing.

    The shape that answers guids is neither of those: it is `template_column`
    set to `item` with no join, which is what porting AzerothCore's column name
    onto CMaNGOS's flat shape produces. That is the mistake the catalog block
    exists to make deliberate, and the flat shape is chosen on these trees
    because it is one hop and cannot lose a row to a missing join.

    (Vanilla's half of that was read on m910q, 2026-09-07:
    `~/vanilla-75b/src/mangos-classic/sql/base/characters.sql:339-347` and
    `src/game/Entities/Player.cpp:3832`. That the two shapes agree ROW FOR ROW
    on a loaded database is a source reading, not a live one -- 8.4c's gate
    counts the difference on the running server.)

    **The name is matched by a JOIN and the owner comes back with the row**,
    which is 8.4c's other correction. It used to be
    `ci.guid = (SELECT guid FROM characters WHERE name = ...)`, a scalar
    subquery on a column no core makes unique -- so on a server with two
    characters of one name the read did not answer the wrong set, it died with
    *"Subquery returns more than 1 row"*, and the tab drew "is wearing nothing"
    over the wreck. Selecting the owner beside the item means the ambiguity is
    visible in the answer rather than in the database engine's error, and it
    costs no extra round trip. See `Ambiguous`.
