"""A ready-to-play client: a per-server folder built from the player's own WoW client (T181a).

Why a separate folder at all: pointing the player's own client at a Yu'lon
server means writing its `realmlist.wtf` (and, in later T181 steps, patching
`Wow.exe`), and then the client no longer reaches whatever it reached before.
A folder per server keeps the original untouched.

Why hard links: a 3.3.5a client is ~15-17 GB, almost all of it in `*.MPQ`
archives that WoW only ever reads. Hard-linking those (and the `*.dll`s, also
read-only) makes a second folder cost 50-300 MB. Everything else is a real
copy, because WoW writes to it (`WTF/`, `Interface/`, every `realmlist.wtf`),
and a write through a hard link would land in the original too. So the rule is
by suffix and nothing else: a file is linked only when its suffix is `.mpq` or
`.dll`. Where the filesystem can clone (btrfs, XFS: `FICLONE`), a clone is used
instead of a link - same space saving, no shared inode at all.

Links cannot cross volumes. A target on another drive therefore means a full
copy, which only happens once the player agreed to its size
(`allow_full_copy`); until then it is refused with the size in the message.

Creation is all-or-nothing: everything is built in `<target>.yulon-partial`,
whose marker is written before any client file, and renamed into place at the
end. Any failure removes the partial folder; a crash leaves one carrying a
marker, which the next attempt recognises as Yu'lon's own and removes. Nothing
is ever deleted from a folder without that marker.

Afterwards the folder is kept in step, not rebuilt: a patcher that replaces an
archive in the original breaks the hard link, and `stale()`/`refresh()` find and
re-share exactly those (and `Wow.exe`), never touching `WTF/` or `Interface/`.
`delete()` removes the folder only when its marker names the same game and server.

No Qt here: the dialog that asks and the progress it shows live in the view.
