"""Uninstall one install: its folder, its Docker project, its record (8.9a).

The design of record is `pyplan/phase8-decisions.md` (2026-08-31). One action per
install, scoped to exactly what Yu'lon created — **the server folder, that
install's compose project, and its entry in `state.json`** — and reaching
nothing else on the machine. An unticked "Keep my characters" decides whether
the database volume survives.

Split in two the way that page asks for, because the dialog must show real
numbers before anything is touched:

* `Uninstaller.plan()` resolves the project, lists its containers and volumes,
  measures the folder and reports what it could not determine. It **reads
  only**, and a refusal comes back as `PurgePlan.refusal` rather than as an
  exception, because a dialog has to show it.
* `Uninstaller.run()` executes, and raises `PurgeError` rather than doing half
  of it.

**The order is the specification, not an implementation detail.** The log
snapshot is taken FIRST and the record is forgotten LAST:

* first, because `remove_staged()` takes the container with it and the
  container's log with that — and because `logsnap.capture()` resolves the
  container through `compose ps` in the server dir, so it can only answer while
  the folder and its compose files are still there. So can
  `docker.install_project()`, which on a real install falls back to
  `compose config` in that directory. The project name is therefore resolved
  and captured into a variable before anything on disk is removed.
* last, because a failed uninstall must leave the record pointing at a server
  that is still there — the recoverable failure — rather than leave a folder no
  surface can reach. A record forgotten early makes an install nobody owns, and
  that is precisely the state the ownership refusal cannot recover from.

**Ownership is proved before anything is removed, and OWNED is the only value
that authorises a delete.** `UNKNOWN` refuses because it is the case the app
knows least about. `UNCLAIMED` refuses too, and this is the half that is easy
to get wrong: `state.json` records whatever folder "Use existing…" was pointed
at, so a user who adopted their own hand-built AzerothCore tree has a record
naming a folder Yu'lon never created and that carries no `.yulon-install.json`.
Written as `if claim is UNKNOWN: refuse`, that user loses their server. The two
refusals are worded differently because the advice differs.

**Every command is scoped to the compose project, and every object is
discovered rather than computed.** AzerothCore pins container names GLOBALLY
(`ac-worldserver`, not `<project>-worldserver`), so two installs of one game
share them: anything that went by name would tear down the neighbour's running
server. Volumes are listed by the project label and removed by the names Docker
gave back — not by sanitising a folder basename, which is how the bash prior
art (`guides/uninstall.sh:136`) came to hardcode
`wow-server-playerbots_ac-database`.

**Images are removed one ref at a time, never with a compose flag.** Measured
on yulon-ubuntu 2026-09-08: this project's images are the four
`yulon.local/ac-wotlk-*:native-<id>` builds plus `mysql:8.4`, which a second
WotLK install also uses. `--rmi all` would take the shared one; `--rmi local`
removes only untagged images and would take none of ours. So
`composegen.built_image_refs()`'s four refs are removed explicitly, and an
image another title is holding comes back as a warning rather than as a failed
uninstall. Nothing here prunes: `image prune`, `builder prune` and
`system prune` reach the whole daemon, and `alpine/git` — the sha256-pinned
image every install's clone stage uses — shows up untagged, which is to say it
looks exactly like something a prune should take.

**A ticked box keeps the password too, or keeps nothing.** The volume it keeps
was created with a password that, on every `generated` entry, lives in a file
inside the folder this action deletes — so "keep my characters" kept a database
nothing could open (the 8.9b lane, reading this module, 2026-09-08).
`yulon.dbsecret` holds that argument and the copy; here it is two lines in
`run()`, placed with the refusals and BEFORE the first destructive step,
because a copy that could not be made has to stop the press rather than be
discovered afterwards.

it was never decided by the design; the owner decided it on 2026-09-08 (answer
3, `pyplan/phase8-owner-answers-2026-09-08.md`): a TICKED purge keeps it, so
the reinstall that keeps the characters does not re-download 3.2 GB of maps;
an UNTICKED purge removes it, because "remove everything" that leaves 3.2 GB
behind is the surprise nobody wants. Until then the ticked press removed it

"""What this action does not reach, in the words the dialog shows.

Owner answer 1 (2026-08-31) is a list of exclusions, and a destructive action
has to be able to state its whole blast radius before it is confirmed — which
is the one idea worth taking from `Uninstall-DML.ps1:120-130`.

The last line is the one no document decided. The credential file
(`credentials/<game>-<install_id>.json`) and the log snapshots are keyed by the
same path-derived install id, so a reinstall to the same folder inherits both.
After a TICKED purge that is right — same database, same account. After an
unticked one the credential is a secret for a database that no longer exists.
Removing it is not done here because owner answer 1 says "only the launcher's
own state record", and this module does not widen an owner's answer on its own;
it is named to the user instead, and named again in the gate plan as a question
for the owner.

The kept database password (`dbsecret`) is the third thing under that directory
and the only one this action WRITES. It is named in the same line rather than a
new one because a user reading the dialog is being told one thing — that a
directory of Yu'lon's own is not part of the blast radius — and because it is
written only on the ticked path, which is the path whose whole purpose is that
something survives.

    every inode in a 1.3 GB `.git` for nothing.

    UNCLAIMED and refuses forever. `_clear_read_only()` clears the bit and the

    `remove_title_fs()` is `let _ = std::fs::remove_dir_all(...)` on every

    `FILE_ATTRIBUTE_READONLY` — so on Windows that launcher reports a
    successful uninstall having deleted nothing. That is the failure this

    what to look at.
