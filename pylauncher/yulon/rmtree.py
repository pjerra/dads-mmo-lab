"""Deleting a directory tree on a filesystem that argues about it.

A leaf module on purpose: `os`, `shutil`, `stat`, `pathlib` and the logger, and
nothing of Yu'lon's. It exists because the retry below was written inside
`purge.py`, where the four other callers that needed it could not reach it --
`purge` transitively imports `apply` and `git`, so `apply -> purge` is a cycle.
A user on Windows found that out the hard way (T49):

    remove sod FAILED: [WinError 5] Access is denied:
    'C:\\wow-server-playerbots\\ale_scripts\\sod\\.git\\objects\\pack\\pack-2623....idx'

The MECHANISM lives here. The SENTENCE stays with each caller: `purge` tells a
user that everything else in the uninstall plan is already gone, and that is
true of an uninstall and false of removing one module.
