Provides line-by-line stdout streaming so the UI can display install/build/

concurrently on a background thread — this exists purely to avoid pipe-buffer
deadlock (a chatty stderr filling its OS pipe buffer while nobody reads it),
not to interleave stderr into the stream in real time: stderr lines are
yielded only after the process exits and stdout is exhausted — unless the
caller asks for `merge_stderr`, which puts both on one pipe for commands whose
real output IS stderr (BuildKit). See `stream()`'s docstring for the exact

    Measured on m910q, 2026-09-04, CPython 3.11.15: a driver that took five
    lines off `docker.follow_logs()` and `break`d, without closing the
    iterator, exited **134 (SIGABRT)**:

        Fatal Python error: _enter_buffered_busy: could not acquire lock for
        <_io.BufferedReader name=5> at interpreter shutdown, possibly due to
        daemon threads
        Python runtime state: finalizing
          Garbage-collecting
          File ".../yulon/runner.py", line 236 in stream

    The abandoned generator survived to interpreter shutdown and was finalised
    by the shutdown garbage collection. By then the `_drain_stderr` daemon
    thread was blocked in `read()` holding the `BufferedReader`'s lock and
    could no longer be resumed — a daemon thread that asks for the GIL after
    finalisation has begun is exited on the spot, lock still held. `join()`
    therefore timed out and `proc.stderr.close()` hit a lock nobody would ever
    release; CPython treats that as a fatal error rather than a hang.

    `atexit` callbacks run BEFORE that finalisation: the interpreter is intact
    and daemon threads still get the GIL. Two shapes were measured on the same
    box and day. A generator held SUSPENDED at a `yield` — the driver above —
    was closed here, its `finally` ran the terminate-and-join, and the driver
    exited 0. A generator whose frame another thread was RUNNING — the app's
    shape: `native._pump()`'s worker inside `docker.run_attached()`, blocked
    in `readline()` inside this generator — refused the close:

        ValueError: generator already executing

    That was logged at debug and nothing else happened: the `finally` never
    ran, and the child was still alive with PPID 1 after the driver had gone
    (`test_runner.py`, both shapes). A frame that is executing cannot be
    entered from here, so its CHILD is ended directly instead; the thread
    that owns the frame then leaves its read on EOF and runs the `finally`
    itself, on a process that has already exited.

    Rejected: **not closing `proc.stderr` when the reader is still alive.** It
    moves the abort rather than removing it — the `BufferedReader`'s
    deallocation calls `close()` itself, that call takes the same lock and
    reaches the same `_enter_buffered_busy`. Measured on the same box and the
    same reproducer: still 134, still `_enter_buffered_busy`, now reported at
    the end of the `finally` instead of at the `close()` line. Also rejected:
    making the reader a non-daemon thread, so `threading._shutdown()` would
    join it before finalisation. Nothing has terminated the child at that
    point, so the join lasts as long as the child does — a launcher that will
    not close is worse than one that aborts on close.

    Every subprocess this module spawns is a console-less utility (git, docker

    default — a window that flashes over the launcher UI on every one of the
    dozen short-lived commands a single server action runs, and that a user can
    close while the build it belongs to is still running (`rust-prior-art.md`
    §4, "spawn with CREATE_NO_WINDOW or consoles flash over the UI").

    Public (not `_`-prefixed) because the three spawn sites that do not go through
    this module's `run()`/`stream()`/`interact()` — `apply.py`'s SQL runner,
    `maintenance.py`'s `docker exec`, and `console.py`'s `docker attach` client

    some spawn sites but not others is a window that flashes anyway. `console.py`'s
    attach is POSIX-only by `pty_supported()`, so the flag is inert there today;
    it is carried anyway so the one place that *can* add a Windows console does
    not silently become the exception. The same reason `git.CONTAINER_GIT_IMAGE`
    is public: a value that must be shared exactly rather than re-derived.

    Fetched off `subprocess` at call time rather than imported at module scope,

    type-checked for POSIX too — the same reason `pty_supported()` does not name

    child process inherits it, and a system binary that links anything the
    bundle also ships then loads the BUNDLE's copy. Measured inside the v0.6.5

    Stdout lines are yielded one at a time as they arrive. Stderr is **not**
    interleaved in real time — it is drained on a background thread purely to
    prevent a full pipe buffer from deadlocking the child, then yielded in one
    block after stdout is exhausted and the process has exited. Each yielded
    line has its trailing newline removed.

    If the caller abandons the generator before it's exhausted (e.g. `break`s
    out of a `for line in stream(...):` loop, or the generator is garbage
    collected), the child process is terminated (escalating to `kill()` after
    a timeout) and the stderr-reader thread is joined before the generator
    finishes unwinding — the child and thread are never silently orphaned.
    That is why the return type is a `Generator` and not an `Iterator`: the
    `close()` is part of the contract, and a caller that stops early should say
    so (`contextlib.closing`) rather than leave it to refcounting.

    A caller that does NOT say so is still owed an exit that is not a crash.
    Every generator handed out is registered weakly in `_LIVE_STREAMS`, and
    `_close_abandoned_streams()` closes whatever is left at `atexit` — the last

    another thread is executing right then, ends the child it started. Its
    docstring carries the measured abort, the measured refusal, and the two
    alternatives that were rejected. This function is a plain function
    returning a generator, not a generator function, purely so the
    registration happens at the call; nothing else about it changed — the body
    is still lazy, so no process starts until the first `next()`. Both halves
    of that sentence are owned by
    `test_runner.py::test_stream_registers_at_the_call_and_starts_no_process_until_the_first_next`,
    added 2026-09-05 when the meta review found the laziness half claimed by a
    comment and asserted by nothing.

        command: The argv list to execute (no shell interpolation).
        cwd: Optional working directory for the child process.
        merge_stderr: Send the child's stderr into the SAME pipe as its stdout,
            so both are yielded live and in the order the child wrote them.
            Added for the native install engine's build stage (roadmap 6.2):
            BuildKit writes all of its progress to stderr, and the default
            ordering above turns a two-to-four-hour compile into a blank log
            panel that only fills in once the build has already finished.
            Interleaving costs the ability to tell the two streams apart, which
            is why it is opt-in: every existing caller reads a command whose
            stderr is an error report rather than its output.

    Yields:
        Each output line (all of stdout, in order, then any stderr) as a
        string without a trailing newline. With `merge_stderr`, one interleaved
        stream in the child's own order.

    Raises:
        subprocess.CalledProcessError: If the command exits non-zero (only
            raised if the generator is fully exhausted normally).

    `cancel` is checked every loop turn: setting it interrupts even a child
    sitting on a prompt no rule answers, which otherwise blocks forever
    (review finding, 2026-08-21) — the child is then terminated as usual.

    Stdout and stderr are merged and read in chunks, so a prompt that does not
    end in a newline (`read -p`, `echo -n ...; read`) still surfaces: once a
    partial line has been quiet for `quiet_seconds`, `respond()` is asked about
    it. `respond()` also sees every complete line. Whenever it returns a
    string, that string plus a newline is written to the child's input. Lines
    are yielded raw (with colour codes); `respond()` receives them stripped.

    `ask` is the escape hatch for the one prompt no rule can answer: sudo's
    password. It is consulted ONLY when the pending text contains `ask_marker`,
    an exact string the caller arranged for the child to print. Without a
    marker `ask` is never called at all — a deliberate dead default, because the
    previous version guessed from the shape of a line and could not tell a
    password prompt from `[ 43%]`.

    `terminal=True` runs the child on a pseudo-terminal and makes that terminal
    its controlling tty. This is what the sudo case needs and a pipe cannot
    give: sudo reads from /dev/tty precisely so that a piped stdin cannot feed
    it a password. Measured — a child reading stdin answers through a pipe, the
    same child reading /dev/tty does not, and real sudo says "a terminal is
    required to read the password". POSIX only; ignored where `pty_supported()`
    is False, which is every Windows box and no installer host (the catalog's
    install scripts are Linux-only).

    Raises `subprocess.CalledProcessError` on non-zero exit, like `stream()`.
    If the generator is abandoned early the child is terminated (then killed)
    and its reader thread joined, exactly like `stream()`.
