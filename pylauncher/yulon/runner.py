"""Shared subprocess streaming wrapper.

Provides line-by-line stdout streaming so the UI can display install/build/
container output without buffering the whole run. Stderr is drained
concurrently on a background thread — this exists purely to avoid pipe-buffer
deadlock (a chatty stderr filling its OS pipe buffer while nobody reads it),
not to interleave stderr into the stream in real time: stderr lines are
yielded only after the process exits and stdout is exhausted — unless the
caller asks for `merge_stderr`, which puts both on one pipe for commands whose
real output IS stderr (BuildKit). See `stream()`'s docstring for the exact

    * a process started between taskkill's snapshot and its kill. compose
      starts `buildx bake` once, at the start of a build, so the window is a
      Stop landing in the first moments of that one command.

    lines off `docker.follow_logs()` and `break`d, without closing the

        Fatal Python error: _enter_buffered_busy: could not acquire lock for

          File ".../yulon/runner.py", line 236 in stream

    The abandoned generator survived to interpreter shutdown and was finalised
    by the shutdown garbage collection. By then the `_drain_stderr` daemon
    thread was blocked in `read()` holding the `BufferedReader`'s lock and
    could no longer be resumed — a daemon thread that asks for the GIL after
    finalisation has begun is exited on the spot, lock still held. `join()`
    therefore timed out and `proc.stderr.close()` hit a lock nobody would ever
    release; CPython treats that as a fatal error rather than a hang.

    `atexit` callbacks run BEFORE that finalisation: the interpreter is intact
    and daemon threads still get the GIL. Two shapes were measured on the same
    box and day. A generator held SUSPENDED at a `yield` — the driver above —
    was closed here, its `finally` ran the terminate-and-join, and the driver
    exited 0. A generator whose frame another thread was RUNNING — the app's
    shape: `native._pump()`'s worker inside `docker.run_attached()`, blocked
    in `readline()` inside this generator — refused the close:

        ValueError: generator already executing

    That was logged at debug and nothing else happened: the `finally` never
    ran, and the child was still alive with PPID 1 after the driver had gone
    (`test_runner.py`, both shapes). A frame that is executing cannot be
    entered from here, so its CHILD is ended directly instead; the thread
    that owns the frame then leaves its read on EOF and runs the `finally`
    itself, on a process that has already exited.

    Rejected: **not closing `proc.stderr` when the reader is still alive.** It
    moves the abort rather than removing it — the `BufferedReader`'s
    deallocation calls `close()` itself, that call takes the same lock and
    reaches the same `_enter_buffered_busy`. Measured on the same box and the
    same reproducer: still 134, still `_enter_buffered_busy`, now reported at
    the end of the `finally` instead of at the `close()` line. Also rejected:
    making the reader a non-daemon thread, so `threading._shutdown()` would
    join it before finalisation. Nothing has terminated the child at that
    point, so the join lasts as long as the child does — a launcher that will

    the read returns EOF, and the thread runs the generator's own `finally`.

    **Keyed on the thread, because a cancel token cannot get there.** `stream()`
    is reached through wrappers — `docker.follow_logs()`, `run_attached()` — and
    a token would have to be threaded through every one of them by every caller;
    the Console tab's call site passes none today, which is the other half of
    what the gate measured. A thread ident is something the caller of a job
    already has, and it says exactly what a Stop button means: end what MY job
    started. `docker.repair_import()`, whose docstring records that it "cannot
    be cancelled, deliberately", runs on its own worker and so stays out of
    reach — the filter is what keeps that promise, not the absence of a
    parameter.

    **It ends only what is live NOW.** A stream the same thread starts a moment
    later is not affected, so a cancelled install's cleanup and rollback steps
    still get to run. That is the difference between this and an ambient
    per-thread cancel, which was the alternative and would have killed them.

    **It does not wait, and that is the prior art's lesson, not ours.**
    `origin/rust-main:crates/dml-core/src/proc.rs`'s `abandon()` — read on the
    branch, because `pyplan/rust-prior-art.md` is silent on that file — says:
    "`kill()` can fail, and the `wait()` that followed it was then INFINITE
    against a process whose whole problem is that it outlives the deadline.
    Measured 2026-08-03: a 600ms-bounded call returned after 605 SECONDS."
    `_end_child()` ends in an unbounded `proc.wait()` and the caller here is the
    thread that painted the button, so each ending goes to a thread nobody
    joins — exactly `abandon()`'s shape. A thread that cannot start (`can't

    Stdout lines are yielded one at a time as they arrive. Stderr is **not**
    interleaved in real time — it is drained on a background thread purely to
    prevent a full pipe buffer from deadlocking the child, then yielded in one
    block after stdout is exhausted and the process has exited. Each yielded
    line has its trailing newline removed.

    If the caller abandons the generator before it's exhausted (e.g. `break`s
    out of a `for line in stream(...):` loop, or the generator is garbage
    collected), the child process is terminated (escalating to `kill()` after
    a timeout) and the stderr-reader thread is joined before the generator
    finishes unwinding — the child and thread are never silently orphaned.
    That is why the return type is a `Generator` and not an `Iterator`: the
    `close()` is part of the contract, and a caller that stops early should say
    so (`contextlib.closing`) rather than leave it to refcounting.

    A caller that does NOT say so is still owed an exit that is not a crash.
    Every generator handed out is registered weakly in `_LIVE_STREAMS`, and
    `_close_abandoned_streams()` closes whatever is left at `atexit` — the last
    moment at which the cleanup above can still run — or, for a frame that
    another thread is executing right then, ends the child it started. Its
    docstring carries the measured abort, the measured refusal, and the two
    alternatives that were rejected. This function is a plain function
    returning a generator, not a generator function, purely so the
    registration happens at the call; nothing else about it changed — the body
    is still lazy, so no process starts until the first `next()`. Both halves
    of that sentence are owned by
    `test_runner.py::test_stream_registers_at_the_call_and_starts_no_process_until_the_first_next`,
    added 2026-09-05 when the meta review found the laziness half claimed by a
    comment and asserted by nothing.

    Args:
        command: The argv list to execute (no shell interpolation).
        cwd: Optional working directory for the child process.
        merge_stderr: Send the child's stderr into the SAME pipe as its stdout,
            so both are yielded live and in the order the child wrote them.
            Added for the native install engine's build stage (roadmap 6.2):
            BuildKit writes all of its progress to stderr, and the default
            ordering above turns a two-to-four-hour compile into a blank log
            panel that only fills in once the build has already finished.
            Interleaving costs the ability to tell the two streams apart, which
            is why it is opt-in: every existing caller reads a command whose
            stderr is an error report rather than its output.
        env: The child's WHOLE environment, or None to inherit this process's.
            Either way it goes through `child_env()`. Added for T376, whose
            build hands each compose call its own `BUILDX_CONFIG`.

    Yields:
        Each output line (all of stdout, in order, then any stderr) as a
        string without a trailing newline. With `merge_stderr`, one interleaved
        stream in the child's own order.

    Raises:
        subprocess.CalledProcessError: If the command exits non-zero (only
            raised if the generator is fully exhausted normally).
            `StreamEnded`, a subclass, when `end_streams_started_on()` ended it.

    `stream()` for the one command whose real output is stderr with no newlines

    every respect that matters: this one reads both pipes on their own threads
    and merges them through a queue, and it cuts a fragment at `\r` — which
    `stream()` must never do, since a `\r` inside a line of a build log is part
    of that line.

    **It does not promise the child's own ordering across the two pipes**, and
    could not: two independent reader threads race, so a stdout fragment and a
    stderr fragment written a microsecond apart can be queued either way round.
    What holds is the order WITHIN each pipe. That is enough for git, whose
    progress is all stderr and whose stdout is silent, and it is the claim this
    docstring made too strongly until the 2026-09-12 review.

    Git is what needs it, and `_FRAGMENT` carries the recording that says why.
    `stream(merge_stderr=True)` was tried first and is not enough: merging puts
    both pipes in the child's own order, but the fragments still arrive as one
    newline-terminated line per phase, so the clone stage went from silence to
    "done" with nothing in between.

    `env` is the complete environment for the child, through `child_env()` and
    with `run()`'s meaning: it REPLACES this process's rather than adding to it,
    so a caller that only wants a variable added copies `os.environ` and extends
    it. `git.py` passes `_no_prompt_env()`, which is that copy plus the four
    variables that stop a credential helper opening a prompt — the guard
    `_run_git()` has always had, and the one this function went without until
    the 2026-09-12 review.

    Yields:
        Each fragment of either stream, with its own separator removed, decoded
        UTF-8 and undecodable bytes replaced. **Order holds WITHIN each pipe and
        not across the two**: the two pipes are read by independent threads, so
        a stdout fragment and a stderr fragment written a microsecond apart can
        arrive either way round.

    Raises:
        subprocess.CalledProcessError: if the command exits non-zero, AFTER
            everything it wrote has been yielded — the tail of git's stderr is
            what says why a clone failed.

    Stdout and stderr are merged and read in chunks, so a prompt that does not
    end in a newline (`read -p`, `echo -n ...; read`) still surfaces: once a
    partial line has been quiet for `quiet_seconds`, `respond()` is asked about
    it. `respond()` also sees every complete line. Whenever it returns a
    string, that string plus a newline is written to the child's input. Lines
    are yielded raw (with colour codes); `respond()` receives them stripped.

    `ask` is the escape hatch for the one prompt no rule can answer: sudo's
    password. It is consulted ONLY when the pending text contains `ask_marker`,
    an exact string the caller arranged for the child to print. Without a
    marker `ask` is never called at all — a deliberate dead default, because the

    its controlling tty. This is what the sudo case needs and a pipe cannot

    it a password. Measured — a child reading stdin answers through a pipe, the
    same child reading /dev/tty does not, and real sudo says "a terminal is
    required to read the password". POSIX only; ignored where `pty_supported()`
    is False, which is every Windows box and no installer host (the catalog's
    install scripts are Linux-only).

    Raises `subprocess.CalledProcessError` on non-zero exit, like `stream()`.
