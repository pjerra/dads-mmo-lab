"""The first start after an update: put the previous build out with the rubbish — carefully.

The helper moves the entries the build ships into `<target>/.yulon-old/` and
leaves them there on purpose: it is the way back the README tells a player how
to use by hand, and it has to survive until the new build has actually opened.

**This module never moves a build entry.** It deletes marked working
directories, and it reports. That is the whole of what it may do, and the rule
is the same one the swap helper exists for: **the running app never renames its
own files.**

A version of this file did restore entries in place, and it was removed on the
lead's decision (2026-09-21). Three things were wrong with it:

* it ran **inside the live process** and renamed `<target>/_internal` — the
  directory that process is executing out of. On Linux the rename succeeds and
  every later lazy import reads the new tree through the old path; on Windows
  the loaded files are locked and it fails.
* it had **no undo of its own**: an `OSError` on the second entry returned
  "could not put it right" with the first entry already swapped back, which is
  the mixed-version install the whole design is built to prevent.
* it was reachable **almost never**. Entries leave executable-FIRST and arrive
  executable-LAST, so every kill point of a half-done swap leaves the target
  with no executable at all — the app cannot start, so nothing here can run.
  With an executable present the only states are untouched, swap complete, and
  rollback complete. The in-place repair was the most dangerous kind of code
  for the rarest state.

So a half-done swap is **reported and nothing is touched**: the message says
what is where and gives the one instruction `pylauncher/README.md` carries, and
`tests/test_selfupdate_recovery.py` executes that instruction at every kill
point. A player whose install has no executable has that path anyway, because
the app cannot start to offer them anything else.

**Three things are checked before anything is deleted** (cold review 1). The
first version of this file deleted `<target>.old` on sight — which, for an
install unpacked into a Downloads folder, was the player's own documents. Now:

1. the directory must carry a marker this app wrote (`layout.is_ours`);
2. the marker's `to_version` must be **the version now running**, so a start of
   the OLD build never throws away the backup it might need;
3. every entry the marker names must be present in the install folder, so a
   swap that stopped part-way is reported rather than tidied away.

Never raises. It runs while the window is being built, and a launcher that will
not open because it could not delete a folder is a worse bug than a folder left
on disk.
