"""8.8 — this install's two entries in the Steam library, on Linux and the Deck.

Two shortcuts per install and no more: the **server launcher** (this app, so a
Deck in Gaming Mode can open Yu'lon and press Start without leaving the couch)
and the **game client** (a Windows executable, so it needs a compatibility tool).
Both go into one binary file, `userdata/<id>/config/shortcuts.vdf`, with their
artwork beside it under `grid/` and the client's Proton named in the *other*,
text file, `config/config.vdf`.

Four things here are not obvious and each one cost a read to find out:

* **Steam owns that file while it is open.** It holds the shortcut list in
  memory and rewrites it on exit, discarding anything written underneath it.
  So this refuses while `pgrep -x steam` answers, and says so — a write that
  quietly evaporates twenty minutes later is worse than no button.
* **`~/.steam/steam` is a symlink to `~/.local/share/Steam`** on an ordinary
  box (measured on `yulon-arch`, 2026-09-10). The prior art walks three roots
  and appends a candidate per root, which is harmless for an add-only routine
  that takes the first. It is not harmless here, where "more than one profile"
  is a refusal: `find_profile()` de-duplicates by `Path.resolve()` before it
  counts, or every single-account machine gets told it has two accounts.
* **The stored `appid` is not always derivable.** Of the two entries captured
  off a real Deck, one still equals `crc32(Exe + AppName) | 0x80000000` and the
  other does not — Steam keeps the appid it first issued when a shortcut is
  renamed or re-pointed, and seven other derivations were tried against it
  without a match. Grid artwork is named `<appid>*.png` with no lookup table,
  so an upsert that recomputed the appid of an entry it is *replacing* would
  orphan four files and blank the tile. `gen_appid` is for entries this creates;
  a replace keeps what it finds.
* **The document ends `08 08`** — one END for the `shortcuts` map, one for the
  root — and a file missing that second byte makes Steam drop *every* non-Steam
  shortcut in the library, not just ours. `terminated()` is checked before the
  bytes reach the disk.

The prior art is `origin/rust-main:docs/reference/dmlpack/dmlpack.py` (the codec
at `:245-295`, `gen_appid` at `:297`, `register_shortcuts` at `:1558-1645`). The
codec and the appid are ports of it. Three things are new here because upstream
does not do them: the artwork, the compatibility tool, and replace-on-second-
press — upstream is add-only and says so out loud when it leaves an entry alone.

Nothing in this module runs on Windows or macOS. The button is not built there
at all (`controller_view._steam_seam()` answers `None`), and `add()` refuses as
well, because a seam that trusts its caller is a seam that gets called wrong.
