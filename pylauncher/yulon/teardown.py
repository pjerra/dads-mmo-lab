"""What may not be cut off, and what is said when it is running (T690).

A server tab is torn down by several doors: the window's close, the tray's Quit,
the self-update's restart, a changed WSL distro, a changed client folder, a made
or deleted ready-to-play client, and "Remove from Yu'lon". Each used to ask its
own, shorter question, and a Restore, a backup or a Start/Stop/Restart went
unseen by most of them; a tab torn down in the middle of one blocked the window
for minutes and then left the job half done.

`ControllerView.teardown_work()` is the ONE list of what must not be cut off,
and it answers with one of the kinds below. Every door asks it through
`ControllerView.teardown_refusal()` (or `forget_refusal()`, which words the same
answer for a removal). This module only holds the kinds and the plain-words
sentence for each, Qt-free so a test can read every sentence without a widget.

A door REFUSES, and does not ask "stop it anyway?" -- except the doors that end Yu'lon
(`yulon.ui.quit_anyway`): a refusal with no way past it would make a flag stuck by a bug
unquittable, so a refused quit or close also offers "Quit anyway", with its cost in plain
words. The client-folder doors keep the plain refusal; a player can always wait there.
A Stop may be quit over (`STOP_JOB`). A restore stopped half-way
leaves the databases half-written, and the jobs here cannot be stopped from the
dialog anyway; `busy_reason()`'s import, reset and uninstall already refuse in
the same way, so a player meets one behaviour for "Yu'lon is still working".
