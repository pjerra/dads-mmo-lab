    `_existing_ancestor()` therefore walks up and opens on the PARENT with

    Default is Yes. The suggestion is right for nearly every install, and the
    one it is wrong for - a second install of the same game - is a folder the
    user is already thinking about.

    Cancel is the Escape button, named. With only Yes and No, Qt made No the

    Adopting one under the wrong catalog entry produces a tab whose every button
    names containers that do not exist, failing separately and confusingly
    instead of once and clearly.

    The catalog's container names are the evidence; the project name is a folder
    name and proves nothing.

    `UNVERIFIED` rather than a refusal when the file cannot be read at all. The
    folder lives inside a distro and is reached over a UNC path, and that read
    can fail for reasons unrelated to which game it is - refusing on "I could
    not check" would block the migration this feature exists to provide. That
    reasoning is unchanged and is why this still does not refuse.

    WITHDRAWN, from the version of this docstring that said True on an
    unreadable file: "Adopting one under the wrong catalog entry produces a tab
    whose every button names containers that do not exist" as a statement of the
    WHOLE cost. It is still a cost, and it is still the one the `DIFFERENT`
    branch is written for; it is no longer the largest. A folder that merely
    *looked* adoptable reaches file deletion, which is not an annoyance.

    That chain was re-read link by link on 2026-09-02, in the code rather than
    from the earlier note, and each link is where it says:

      - `adopt_from_wsl()` below emits `adopted` for an `UNVERIFIED` folder
        once the user answers yes to the confirm (it was unconditional when
        this chain was first written, and the chain still holds, because the
        user can say yes);
      - `catalog.json` gives `wow-wotlk` `"has_manifests": true`, and it is the
        only entry of the four that carries it;
      - `controller_view.ControllerServices.for_wotlk()` passes that same
        `server_dir` into `wotlk_modules.applier()` when `entry.has_manifests`,
        and `apply.Applier.__init__` keeps it as `self.server_dir`;
      - `apply.Applier.install()` clones into
        `server_dir / CLONE_DIRS[type] / id`, and `git.RunnerGit.clone()`
        `shutil.rmtree()`s that destination BEFORE the first git invocation.

    The precondition on the deletion, which the earlier note left out: it fires
    only when the destination already exists AND is not itself a git checkout
    (`(dest / ".git").is_dir()` sends it down the update path instead). What is
    deleted is that subdirectory of the adopted folder, not the adopted folder
    itself - still the user's files, still without anyone having established
    that the folder is ours. Because the rmtree precedes the fetch, a clone that
    was never going to succeed deletes anyway. All of this is asserted in
    `test_an_unverified_adoption_reaches_the_applier_with_no_ownership_check`,
    which drives it with only `runner.run` doubled.

    So the answer widened instead of hardening: the migration keeps working, and
    the caller - and the user - are told which of the three they got.

        A QLabel without `setWordWrap` demands its longest line, so every tile
        was as wide as its worst sentence — WotLK's description is 118
        characters, Vanilla's emulator line 66 — and two of those per grid row
        asked for some 3200px where the Catalog tab has under 700. The second
        column, Install buttons and all, was drawn past the right edge of the

        scrollbar most people never looked for, and clickable blind (v0.6.51,
        2026-08-30). Wrapping is what the platform-gate note twenty lines below
        already did; the rest of the tile simply never got it.

        Every line goes through here rather than only the long ones, because
        which line is longest is a property of `catalog.json` — the next entry
        someone adds must not be able to push the buttons off screen again.

            #      for the FIRST time in this dialog. Charging the user for a fact
            #      they were never shown, with nowhere to say "that is not it".
            #   2. The click carried no information. `adopt_from_wsl` returned True
            #      whether the box was dismissed or not, so a user who clicked
            #      through produced exactly what a clean verification produced -

            # adoption moves to just before the emit instead, where it describes
            # something that actually happened - which is what the ordering fix
            # this replaces was really about.
            # The cost sentence is CONDITIONAL, because the flat version was not
            # true. "Installing or removing a module writes into that folder and
            # deletes files under it" describes `Applier`, which only exists for an
            # entry with `has_manifests` - `wow-wotlk` alone of the four when this
            # was written, and `wow-tbc` as well since 8.7b. For Vanilla and
            # Tortoise `controller_view` still passes `applier=None` and DISABLES
            # both module buttons, so the user was being warned about an action
            # they cannot perform. It errs safe, which is exactly why it survived
            # review of the previous wording: a sentence spelled like a true one,
            # aimed at the cost this time instead of the remedy.
            # The condition is the reason this needed no edit when TBC gained
            # manifests: it asks the entry, not a list of game ids. What DID need
            # saying is that TBC's cost is smaller than the sentence implies -
            # every `manifests/wow-tbc/` item is a conf activation or a SQL mod,
            # so nothing there clones and nothing there is deleted. The sentence
            # over-warns rather than under-warns, which is the right way round,
            # and one TBC manifest with a `source` would make it exact again.

        and got it: `usermod` ran, and the very process that ran it cannot see
        the result, because supplementary groups are credentials fixed at login.
        Before this, that user was told to log out and back in — measured on the
        live Ubuntu gate as: consent, sudo, log out, log back in, find the
        launcher, press Install again.

        Asks the MACHINE whether a restart would help, rather than remembering
        that a join happened. `docker_group_reexec()` returns an argv only when
        the group is in the database and not in this process — which is the
        condition, stated exactly, and it is right on the three paths a flag
        gets wrong: the user declined, the join failed, or the group was
        revoked. Each of those leaves the group out of the database, so the
        predicate is false and no restart is offered.

        It does NOT carry a fourth path. The caller runs this on EVERY failed
        install and `docker_group_reexec()` asks nothing about what the failure
        was, so a user who is in the database group but not in this process is
        offered a restart for a download that 404'd or a disk that filled up
        just as readily as for a docker-socket denial. A separate fix made the
        predicate return None under root, which removed the instance that was
        permanently true for every `sudo yulon` install; the general case is
        still live, and the cost of it is one dialog offering a restart that
        will not help. Whenever the predicate says None this returns False and
        the plain warning is shown, unchanged.

        Returns True when it has spoken to the user, so the caller does not also
        show its own dialog: the question below already carries `message` in
        full. `said_yes(...)` and not `not said_yes(...)` inverted, because
        Escape and the window's close button both return `NoButton`, and only
        an explicit Yes may throw away a running application.
