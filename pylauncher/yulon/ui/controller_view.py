"""Controller view — one install's management surface (roadmap 4.3).

Tabs: **Server** (start/stop/status with the README §12 port-conflict message),
**Console** (live worldserver log, a console command line, an accounts form),
**Modules** (the manifests the store knows, install/remove through the shared
applier, the rebuild/restart the report asks for), **Networking** (LAN /
internet play via `networking.plan()` + `apply()`, showing the router steps the
app cannot do). The view only calls down into `Controller`, `Applier`,
`console`, `networking` and signals up; it never shells out itself
(style-guide §3/§5). Every external call is a seam in `ControllerServices` so
the view is testable offscreen with fakes.
