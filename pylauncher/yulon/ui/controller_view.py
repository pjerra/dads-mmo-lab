"""Controller view — one install's management surface (roadmap 4.3).

Tabs: **Server** (start/stop/status with the README §12 port-conflict message),
**Console** (live worldserver log, a console command line, an accounts form),
**Modules** (the manifests the store knows, install/remove through the shared
applier, the rebuild/restart the report asks for), **Networking** (LAN /
internet play via `networking.plan()` + `apply()`, showing the router steps the
app cannot do). The view only calls down into `Controller`, `Applier`,
`console`, `networking` and signals up; it never shells out itself
(style-guide §3/§5). Every external call is a seam in `ControllerServices` so
the view is testable offscreen with fakes.

`ControllerServices.for_entry()` builds those seams out of the installed game's
own `controller_<acronym>` package, chosen by catalog id through `_FACTORIES`.
Until 7.9 this module imported `controller_wow_wotlk` directly and used it for
every install, so a TBC, Vanilla or Tortoise tab drove AzerothCore's package:
its `acore_*` schema names, its `AC>` console prompt and its `ready...` marker
reached servers that have none of them.

    `stopped` was added after yulon-win11-gate refuted the rest of it on
    2026-09-07. The press REFUSES while the world is running -- 8.2a's whole
    shape, because a failed bind is not atomic -- and `stable` is only ever true
    while the world IS running. So the only control that turns the channel on
    was live exactly when pressing it could not work and dead exactly when it
    would, and the refusal sentence asked the user to do the thing that greys
    the button out. A stopped server is the state the press is FOR.

    Everything else stays shut: `restart_loop` and `unknown` are both servers
    that may be running, and the press would refuse or, worse, write a setting
    under a world that is up. `missing` (T95) stays shut too, as it did while
    it still read as `unknown`: it is not the stopped server the press is for
    but a world container that is gone (removed by hand, or never created), and
    `missing` is only as true as the daemon asked (`ContainerState.missing`).

(`REPORT_LINES`, and `_IdleLogPanel`'s cap), and this is what is left if one of
them is ever wrong again -- an error message wrapped into a report box did
exactly that during T73's own review.

Deliberately SHORTER than one row (85px plus its card's header under this
theme): a floor is paid for by whatever is under it, in clipped text, at the
sizes where the tab is already over-subscribed, and the LIST is the one widget
here that is complete at any height because it scrolls. That rule is what sets
the number, and T83 re-applied it at the smaller of the two window sizes the app
allows: 100 was the largest that left the 1280x800 the app OPENS at fitting with
nothing cut, and 74 is the largest that leaves the 960x600 it can be DRAGGED to
fitting too, now that the action bar above takes a second line there (measured
themed: the tab's layout asked for 452px of a 426px tab at 100, and Qt shares a

the font is larger, plus the scroll area's 2px frame. Below this the list is a
header and a row -- the T89 gate photographed it at less than that, the header
alone, on an install past its pins at 960x640 -- and the card's sentence is the
cheapest height on the tab to buy the second row with.

A second floor, above `MODULE_LIST_MIN_HEIGHT` and defended by a different rung

goes to its one line to keep this -- and only where the list would be under it

the card its sentence (T153 round 2). Raising `MODULE_LIST_MIN_HEIGHT` instead

    `QBoxLayout`'s answer to a column whose children's minimums add up to more
    than it has is to draw every one of them in proportion -- so the shortfall is
    paid in cut text, spread over whatever happens to be there. Measured at
    960x600 with a refusal in the report box: the action bar was drawn 74px of
    the 106 its two lines need, its second row of buttons sliced through, and the
    custom-module card 74 of 122. Nothing in a layout can prefer one child over
    another, which is why this object exists: the preference is real, and it is
    this.

    **The order things give in, and it is the whole of the class:**

    1. the LOG folds to its strip. It is the biggest single thing on the tab and
       the one designed to fall back -- the strip carries the job's status line,
       the elapsed clock and Stop, with the output one click away.
    2. the REPORT BOX folds to its strip. Same shape, less of it, and the strip
       names what is behind it.
    3. the CUSTOM-MODULE CARD goes to its one-line form (T153): its title and
       its two buttons on one line, without the sentence that explains them.
       Taken only where the list would be under `MODULE_LIST_ROWS_HEIGHT` --
       a family header and two rows -- even with the log AND the report
       folded, so it is the last thing to go before the list: whatever the
       boxes could have given, they are counted as having given it.
    4. the LIST's floor gives. It scrolls, so it is complete at any height; every
       pixel taken from it is a pixel of a row somebody can still scroll to.

    **And what never gives: a toolbar line, and the card's buttons.** Those are
    the things whose only way of being smaller is to cut the words inside them,
    which is the defect this whole ticket is about. The list is last rather than
    first for the same reason the log is first: order by what a shortfall COSTS
    the reader, not by what is easiest to shrink.

    **Why the card goes to a LINE and not to a strip like the two panels (T153).**
    A strip hides what is behind it until it is pressed, and a press is a
    request this object may refuse: at 960x640 with the version lines, the
    banner and the wrapped bar all on screen, the card whole does not fit even
    with the list at `_LIST_FLOOR_FLOOR`, so a folded card's strip would be a
    handle that does nothing and a small window with no way to install a module
    from a link. The line costs 50px where a strip would cost 14, and it keeps
    both presses on screen at every size the window can be.

    **Why the card and the boxes are decided apart (T153 round 2).** Each is
    decided from a sum the other does not change: the boxes with the card
    billed WHOLE, the card with both boxes billed FOLDED. Chained instead --
    the card decided from what the boxes left -- a taller window that could
    keep the report open had less left over for the list than a shorter one
    that folded it, and the card paid: measured past the pins with a rebuild
    owed, the card was whole at 1280x740 and 1280x760 and on one line at
    1280x800, so dragging the window taller took its sentence away. Apart,
    each of the three is shown at every height above the first it is shown
    at, which is `test_a_taller_window_never_takes_back_what_a_shorter_one_
    showed`. It also leaves T80's shot at 1280x800 as it was: both boxes open
    over a list of under two rows, and the card whole, because folding the
    boxes WOULD give the list its rows -- the card does not give its sentence
    for height the boxes are holding.

    The same separation is what stops a flicker. Read off the form on screen,
    a folded card leaves room over, the room says "unfold", and the unfolded
    card says "fold" -- two transitions per settle, the log's flicker (T83) in
    a third widget. And billing the card as its line for the boxes would move
    the widths at which they fold, which T85's presses are measured against.

    **One thing reorders it: a press on a handle (T85).** Steps 1 and 2 are a
    guess at which of the two panels the reader would rather keep, and a user who
    presses a chevron has just said. That panel goes to the END of the order, so
    the other one gives for it -- `_give_order()`, and the alternative was a
    chevron that does nothing at every size where the two do not both fit. The
    list's place is not up for reordering: it is step 3 whoever pressed what,
    because the list is the one widget here that is complete at any height.

    **Decided from the width the tab has NOW**, which is the second half of what
    this class is for. Every height here is a function of the theme, the theme is
    regenerated at every width the window settles at, and a cached minimum is
    stale until its widget has been polished -- so a decision read out of
    `minimumSizeHint()` while a `LayoutRequest` is in flight is taken against
    half-updated numbers. Measured before `_owed()` asked by width: every themed
    restyle below the fold unfolded the log and refolded it, TWICE per settle at
    every width from 940 to 1110, because the action bar's cached minimum still
    said one line when the log was asked and two by the time it was laid out --
    a visible flash on every drag. `minimumHeightForWidth()` at the tab's current
    width is the same question the layout is about to answer, so there is nothing
    to be stale.

    A zero-interval single-shot timer was written first, to coalesce the decision
    to after the layout pass, and it is not here because it was measured to do
    nothing once `_owed()` stopped reading stale numbers: replacing it with a
    direct call left every test green, including the one that counts folds per
    restyle. `_settling` is the guard that remains, and it is a different job --
    telling the log to fold asks for a layout, and the layout asks here again.

    for its full 240px was a quarter of the tab's height spent on nothing.

    Folded rather than hidden: the strip with the handle, the elapsed field and
    the Stop button stays on screen, so the panel is where it was when a job does
    start. It unfolds itself the first time a run starts -- a job's output is

    of a `QTimer` (T80).

        to `_DB_HEALTHY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` for health, and a GUI thread parked on
        that is a frozen window.

        The backup is a `mysqldump` through `docker exec` into the database
        container, so with the stack stopped -- the ordinary state of a server
        nobody is playing on, and the state a user is in when they press
        "Update the server to latest…" -- it answered *"<db> is not running, so
        there is no database to back up"* and nothing was backed up. Measured on
        the Vanilla box, 2026-09-16 (T64's live gate, `dbdown-*`): the
        recommended button failed on the first press.

        **The same seam the applier uses for direct SQL** (`apply.Applier.
        _start_the_database_for_direct_sql`, T7) and for the same reason: the
        world is never started, only the database, because what is wanted is a
        database process to talk to and not a server that will write over the
        rows being dumped.

        **The database is left as it was found.** `start()` answers whether it
        had to start anything, and only that answer runs `stop()`. Leaving it up
        would be defensible after an update -- the rebuild recreates the whole
        stack a few minutes later -- but this is ONE decision for both buttons,
        and after the plain Backup button there is no rebuild coming: a press
        that quietly left a stopped server's database running is a press that
        changed something the user did not ask about. So it is put back, in both
        places, and the update's own `recreate` stage starts what it needs.

        `finally` and not a tidy line at the end: a backup that fails half way
        through must not leave the container up either, and `MaintenanceError`
        is the ordinary way out of here.

        call), and do not go ahead at all.

        The tab asked nothing and passed nothing until 2026-09-07, which made
        `mod-ah-bot` and `mod-ah-bot-plus` — the only two shipped manifests with

        filled in every prompt that HAD a default and then raised on the one

        The gate is `apply.must_ask()`: since T104 (the owner, "ask all,
        remember answers") every question an install or update renders is put,
        pre-filled with what this install answered last time, else the

        asks_it`, not written here. A manifest that asks nothing gets no window
        and the applier gets `None` rather than `{}` — the call it has always

        until then only a prompt with NO default opened the dialog, so `xp-rates`
        never asked its rates, `sitmeanrest` never asked its seconds, and
        `hearthstone-cd`'s `choice` (T100) applied upstream's RESET file unasked.

        content's own terms rather than on the line's emptiness, this control
        disappears after a successful return and comes back after an update --
        instead of offering a ~36-minute compile that ends exactly where it
        started (live gate, 2026-09-16, press 6).

        Never raises. It is called from the reload path and from every job
        finishing, and an exception on either would take the tab down over a
        line of text; the seam's own contract is that it reads rather than
        raising, and this holds it to that. The fallback hides the button as
        well as the line: a read that failed knows nothing about where the
        sources stand, and offering an hour of compiling off that is worse than
        offering nothing.

        The owner's ask of 2026-09-15 -- "a update server to latest, with a
        warning and recommendation to take a backup before updating" -- as ONE
        question with three answers rather than a warning followed by a separate
        "back up first?". Two dialogs in a row is how a user learns to click
        through the first, and the first is the one carrying the warning.

        **The backup is chained, not awaited.** `services.backup` runs off the
        GUI thread through `_run()` -- it is a `mysqldump` of a live world and
        takes minutes -- so this method returns as soon as it is started and the
        update begins in `_backup_before_update_done()`. What that costs is that
        the return value means "a press started something", not "the update
        started"; what it buys is a window that is not frozen for the length of
        a dump.

        **The backup starts the database if it is down** (T76), through
        `_backup_with_the_database()` and not `services.backup` directly. An
        update is what somebody does to a server nobody is playing on, so the
        stack is normally stopped when this is pressed -- and the backup is a
        `docker exec` into the database container, which refused. The
        recommended button therefore failed on the first press of every stopped
        server until 2026-09-16.

        **A failed backup STOPS**, which is `dml wow update`'s rule
        (`BACKUP_FAILED "Safety backup failed -- update not started"`) and not
        wow-manage's, which offered a backup and continued regardless. Somebody
        who asked for a backup first asked for it because they want one before
        this runs, and "we could not take one, so we did the dangerous thing
        anyway" is the opposite of the answer they gave.

        **And it asks again afterwards.** `Backup saved to {path}. Update now?`,
        No by default. Minutes have passed, the answer is on screen, and the
        person is at a point where saying no costs nothing at all.

        Every answer is read through `said_yes()`/`ask_update_choice()`, never by
        identity: PySide6 6.11's static `question()` returns a plain `int` (T33),

REBUILD_HISTORY = """FACT 4, established 2026-09-07 and overturned 2026-09-08.

Every `QPushButton` in `yulon/ui/` was listed on 2026-09-07 and none of them
rebuilt anything, while `_format_report` ended with

    ⚠ worldserver REBUILD required before this takes effect

for 20 of the 41 shipped manifests -- an instruction that sent its reader
hunting for a control that had never existed. Pressing Install again did not
help either: `catalog/native.py`'s `stage_build()` skips the compile whenever
`built_images()` answers true, and the image tag is derived from the install
folder's name, so adding a module to `modules/` cannot even change the tag
that would make the build stage notice.

The button was built on 2026-09-08 (`ControllerView.rebuild_server()`, the
Modules tab, over `StagedInstaller.rebuild()` with a forced compile). This
note is kept because the sentence is only honest while that control is
reachable, and `test_the_rebuild_sentence_names_a_button_that_is_really_on_the
_tab` is what holds the two together -- it reads the label off the widget and
looks for it in the report the user is shown."""

"""FACT 5, established 2026-09-07, and half of it was overturned on 2026-09-08.

`docker.apply_module_sql()` existed and was measured working on yulon-ubuntu
2026-09-07 — the same one-shot with `AC_UPDATES_ALLOWED_MODULES=mod-aoe-loot`
applied `aoe_loot_module_string.sql` and moved `acore_world.updates` 2967 → 2968
— but no widget called it, so this sentence ended "Yu'lon cannot finish this one
for you yet" and naming a control would have been the same fault as naming a
rebuild button.

The widget was built on 2026-09-08 (`ControllerView.apply_module_sql()`, the
`MODULE_SQL_BUTTON_LABEL` button on the Modules tab), so what stays true here is
only the first half: why the SQL is still sitting there after an install. The

    `/home/user/wowserver`) installed `mod-aoe-loot` and resolved its manifest
    glob `data/sql/db-world/*.sql` to nothing at all. The draft line here read
    "nothing to apply", and it was false: that clone carries

    the very file FACT 1 watched the importer apply, moving `acore_world.updates`

    theirs straight in `db-world/` (mod-solocraft: 1 file; mod-transmog: 3, plus

    glob is Yu'lon's own bookkeeping, not the importer's rule — upstream's
    `UpdateFetcher.cpp:159-186` walks the module's `data/sql` tree itself and

    Two things were wrong with this function on 2026-09-07 and they are the same
    thing twice: it stated as fact what it had not checked, and it named a next
    action that does not exist.

    The ticks came from `ApplyReport.done`, and `apply.py` put its deferred SQL
    step in that list -- so the live applier reported `DONE: sql
    data/sql/db-world/*.sql -> world: left to ac-db-import on next start` over
    an install where the SQL was never applied and nothing was going to apply
    it. That half is fixed in `apply.py`; here it means `pending_sql` is drawn
    with the other mark and the other verb (see `_pending_sql_lines`).

    The closing line said a REBUILD was required, which on 2026-09-07 was true
    and useless: every `QPushButton` in `yulon/ui/` was listed that day and none
    of them rebuilt anything, so the sentence read as an instruction to press
    something that did not exist. It is an instruction again as of 2026-09-08,
    because the button it names was built -- `ControllerView.rebuild_server()`,
    on the banner above the cards, which are above the report this line appears
    in (it said "below" until T155) -- and the label is read from
    `REBUILD_BUTTON_LABEL` rather than retyped, so a rename cannot leave the
    report pointing at nothing.

    It also said it for every C++ module and for nothing else, which is the
    right split by accident -- counted through `parse_manifest` on 2026-09-07,
    `build.rebuild` is true for 20 of the 41 shipped manifests, all of type
    `module`, and false for the other 21 (7 ale, 2 keg, 11 mod, and `mod-arac`).
    A data-only one really does work without a recompile, so "this needs a
    rebuild" and "restart to apply" are two different messages about two
    different halves of the catalog, and the report says which half this item is
    in rather than leaving the reader to infer it from the presence of a
    warning.

    The remove case still does not claim to know what went into the last build.
    The live run on yulon-ubuntu 2026-09-07 removed two modules that had been
    installed minutes earlier and never built, and a draft saying "its code was
    compiled into the worldserver" was false of both -- so it says which case
    would be bad rather than which case this is.

    Nothing here is asserted about the machine. Every claim is about this app's
    own code, which is the same code on Windows as on the Linux box the
    measurements were taken on -- deliberately, because the install the real user
    runs was built by the DML bash installer and this app has never been run
    against one of those.
