"""Controller view — one install's management surface (roadmap 4.3).

Tabs: **Server** (start/stop/status with the README §12 port-conflict message),
**Console** (live worldserver log, a console command line, an accounts form),
**Modules** (the manifests the store knows, install/remove through the shared
applier, the rebuild/restart the report asks for), **Networking** (LAN /
internet play via `networking.plan()` + `apply()`, showing the router steps the
app cannot do). The view only calls down into `Controller`, `Applier`,
`console`, `networking` and signals up; it never shells out itself
(style-guide §3/§5). Every external call is a seam in `ControllerServices` so
the view is testable offscreen with fakes.

`ControllerServices.for_entry()` builds those seams out of the installed game's
own `controller_<acronym>` package, chosen by catalog id through `_FACTORIES`.
Until 7.9 this module imported `controller_wow_wotlk` directly and used it for
every install, so a TBC, Vanilla or Tortoise tab drove AzerothCore's package:
its `acore_*` schema names, its `AC>` console prompt and its `ready...` marker
reached servers that have none of them.
