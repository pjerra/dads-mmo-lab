"""Controller view — one install's management surface (roadmap 4.3).

Tabs: **Server** (start/stop/status with the README §12 port-conflict message),
**Console** (live worldserver log, a console command line, an accounts form),
**Modules** (the manifests the store knows, install/remove through the shared
applier, the rebuild/restart the report asks for), **Networking** (LAN /
internet play via `networking.plan()` + `apply()`, showing the router steps the
app cannot do). The view only calls down into `Controller`, `Applier`,
`console`, `networking` and signals up; it never shells out itself
(style-guide §3/§5). Every external call is a seam in `ControllerServices` so
the view is testable offscreen with fakes.

`ControllerServices.for_entry()` builds those seams out of the installed game's
own `controller_<acronym>` package, chosen by catalog id through `_FACTORIES`.
Until 7.9 this module imported `controller_wow_wotlk` directly and used it for
every install, so a TBC, Vanilla or Tortoise tab drove AzerothCore's package:
its `acore_*` schema names, its `AC>` console prompt and its `ready...` marker
reached servers that have none of them.

REBUILD_HISTORY = """FACT 4, established 2026-09-07 and overturned 2026-09-08.

Every `QPushButton` in `yulon/ui/` was listed on 2026-09-07 and none of them
rebuilt anything, while `_format_report` ended with

    ⚠ worldserver REBUILD required before this takes effect

for 20 of the 41 shipped manifests -- an instruction that sent its reader
hunting for a control that had never existed. Pressing Install again did not
help either: `catalog/native.py`'s `stage_build()` skips the compile whenever
`built_images()` answers true, and the image tag is derived from the install
folder's name, so adding a module to `modules/` cannot even change the tag
that would make the build stage notice.

The button was built on 2026-09-08 (`ControllerView.rebuild_server()`, the
Modules tab, over `StagedInstaller.rebuild()` with a forced compile). This
note is kept because the sentence is only honest while that control is
reachable, and `test_the_rebuild_sentence_names_a_button_that_is_really_on_the
_tab` is what holds the two together -- it reads the label off the widget and
looks for it in the report the user is shown."""

IMPORT_CONTROL = (
    "a Start deliberately skips AzerothCore's importer — it brings up only the three "
    "long-running services — and Repair refuses a database that is already complete, so "
    "nothing you have pressed so far has run it"
)
"""FACT 5, established 2026-09-07, and half of it was overturned on 2026-09-08.

`docker.apply_module_sql()` existed and was measured working on yulon-ubuntu
2026-09-07 — the same one-shot with `AC_UPDATES_ALLOWED_MODULES=mod-aoe-loot`
applied `aoe_loot_module_string.sql` and moved `acore_world.updates` 2967 → 2968
— but no widget called it, so this sentence ended "Yu'lon cannot finish this one
for you yet" and naming a control would have been the same fault as naming a
rebuild button.

The widget was built on 2026-09-08 (`ControllerView.apply_module_sql()`, the
`MODULE_SQL_BUTTON_LABEL` button on the Modules tab), so what stays true here is
only the first half: why the SQL is still sitting there after an install. The
next action is now a button, and the line quotes its label rather than
retyping it."""


def _pending_sql_lines(pending: Sequence[PendingSql]) -> list[str]:
    """One line per deferred SQL step, saying what is on disk and unapplied.

    Three shapes because `PendingSql.files` has three answers — but all three
    say NOT applied, and the empty one earned that the hard way. The first live
    run of this code (yulon-ubuntu, 2026-09-07, the real applier against
    `/home/pk/wowserver`) installed `mod-aoe-loot` and resolved its manifest
    glob `data/sql/db-world/*.sql` to nothing at all. The draft line here read
    "nothing to apply", and it was false: that clone carries
    `data/sql/db-world/base/aoe_loot_module_string.sql`, one directory deeper —
    the very file FACT 1 watched the importer apply, moving `acore_world.updates`
    2967 → 2968 an hour earlier. Two sibling modules cloned the same minute put
    theirs straight in `db-world/` (mod-solocraft: 1 file; mod-transmog: 3, plus
    an `updates/` folder), so the layout is per-repository and the manifest's
    glob is Yu'lon's own bookkeeping, not the importer's rule — upstream's
    `UpdateFetcher.cpp:159-186` walks the module's `data/sql` tree itself and
    never sees that pattern. So "the glob matched nothing" means this app cannot
    count, NOT that the module has no SQL, and replacing one confident lie with
    a quieter one would have been the whole of this box's defect again.

    """The run, drawn so that every tick is something that happened.

    Two things were wrong with this function on 2026-09-07 and they are the same
    thing twice: it stated as fact what it had not checked, and it named a next
    action that does not exist.

    The ticks came from `ApplyReport.done`, and `apply.py` put its deferred SQL
    step in that list -- so the live applier reported `DONE: sql
    data/sql/db-world/*.sql -> world: left to ac-db-import on next start` over
    an install where the SQL was never applied and nothing was going to apply
    it. That half is fixed in `apply.py`; here it means `pending_sql` is drawn
    with the other mark and the other verb (see `_pending_sql_lines`).

    The closing line said a REBUILD was required, which on 2026-09-07 was true
    and useless: every `QPushButton` in `yulon/ui/` was listed that day and none
    of them rebuilt anything, so the sentence read as an instruction to press
    something that did not exist. It is an instruction again as of 2026-09-08,
    because the button it names was built -- `ControllerView.rebuild_server()`,
    one row below the report this line appears in -- and the label is read from
    `REBUILD_BUTTON_LABEL` rather than retyped, so a rename cannot leave the
    report pointing at nothing.

    It also said it for every C++ module and for nothing else, which is the
    right split by accident -- counted through `parse_manifest` on 2026-09-07,
    `build.rebuild` is true for 20 of the 41 shipped manifests, all of type
    `module`, and false for the other 21 (7 ale, 2 keg, 11 mod, and `mod-arac`).
    A data-only one really does work without a recompile, so "this needs a
    rebuild" and "restart to apply" are two different messages about two
    different halves of the catalog, and the report says which half this item is
    in rather than leaving the reader to infer it from the presence of a
    warning.

    The remove case still does not claim to know what went into the last build.
    The live run on yulon-ubuntu 2026-09-07 removed two modules that had been
    installed minutes earlier and never built, and a draft saying "its code was
    compiled into the worldserver" was false of both -- so it says which case
    would be bad rather than which case this is.

    Nothing here is asserted about the machine. Every claim is about this app's
    own code, which is the same code on Windows as on the Linux box the
    measurements were taken on -- deliberately, because the install the real user
    runs was built by the DML bash installer and this app has never been run
    against one of those.
