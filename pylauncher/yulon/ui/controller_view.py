"""Controller view — one install's management surface (roadmap 4.3).

Tabs: **Server** (start/stop/status with the README §12 port-conflict message),
**Console** (live worldserver log, a console command line, an accounts form),
**Modules** (the manifests the store knows, install/remove through the shared
applier, the rebuild/restart the report asks for), **Networking** (LAN /
internet play via `networking.plan()` + `apply()`, showing the router steps the
app cannot do). The view only calls down into `Controller`, `Applier`,
`console`, `networking` and signals up; it never shells out itself
(style-guide §3/§5). Every external call is a seam in `ControllerServices` so
the view is testable offscreen with fakes.

`ControllerServices.for_entry()` builds those seams out of the installed game's
own `controller_<acronym>` package, chosen by catalog id through `_FACTORIES`.
Until 7.9 this module imported `controller_wow_wotlk` directly and used it for
every install, so a TBC, Vanilla or Tortoise tab drove AzerothCore's package:
its `acore_*` schema names, its `AC>` console prompt and its `ready...` marker
reached servers that have none of them.

live on a maximised 1080p desktop that was ~400px of log over a list of a row and

A QUARTER, and the ticket's own suggestion of a third was measured first: a
maximised window on a real 1080p desktop is 47px shorter than the screen (GNOME's
top bar and the title bar), and at that shape a third left the list at 294px and
FOUR rows -- one under the count this is meant to guarantee. A quarter is 213px
there, which is the strip and some eight lines of output, and it leaves five.

Floored at the panel's own minimum by `_share_of_the_tab()`, so on a small window
this can only ever be "as small as the panel is allowed to be" and never a cap
that clips the strip.

this is the number that applies while they have NOT said anything; it is not a
claim that a quarter is always the right amount.

class _TabFit(QObject):
    """What gives when the Modules tab cannot hold everything on it (T83).

    `QBoxLayout`'s answer to a column whose children's minimums add up to more
    than it has is to draw every one of them in proportion -- so the shortfall is
    paid in cut text, spread over whatever happens to be there. Measured at
    960x600 with a refusal in the report box: the action bar was drawn 74px of
    the 106 its two lines need, its second row of buttons sliced through, and the
    custom-module card 74 of 122. Nothing in a layout can prefer one child over
    another, which is why this object exists: the preference is real, and it is
    this.

    **The order things give in, and it is the whole of the class:**

    1. the LOG folds to its strip. It is the biggest single thing on the tab and
       the one designed to fall back -- the strip carries the job's status line,
       the elapsed clock and Stop, with the output one click away.
    2. the REPORT BOX folds to its strip. Same shape, less of it, and the strip
       names what is behind it.
    3. the LIST's floor gives. It scrolls, so it is complete at any height; every
       pixel taken from it is a pixel of a row somebody can still scroll to.

    **And what never gives: a toolbar line, and the custom-module card.** Those
    are the two whose only way of being smaller is to cut the words inside them,
    which is the defect this whole ticket is about. The list is last rather than
    first for the same reason the log is first: order by what a shortfall COSTS
    the reader, not by what is easiest to shrink.

    **One thing reorders it: a press on a handle (T85).** Steps 1 and 2 are a
    guess at which of the two panels the reader would rather keep, and a user who
    presses a chevron has just said. That panel goes to the END of the order, so
    the other one gives for it -- `_give_order()`, and the alternative was a
    chevron that does nothing at every size where the two do not both fit. The
    list's place is not up for reordering: it is step 3 whoever pressed what,
    because the list is the one widget here that is complete at any height.

    **Decided from the width the tab has NOW**, which is the second half of what
    this class is for. Every height here is a function of the theme, the theme is
    regenerated at every width the window settles at, and a cached minimum is
    stale until its widget has been polished -- so a decision read out of
    `minimumSizeHint()` while a `LayoutRequest` is in flight is taken against
    half-updated numbers. Measured before `_owed()` asked by width: every themed
    restyle below the fold unfolded the log and refolded it, TWICE per settle at
    every width from 940 to 1110, because the action bar's cached minimum still
    said one line when the log was asked and two by the time it was laid out --
    a visible flash on every drag. `minimumHeightForWidth()` at the tab's current
    width is the same question the layout is about to answer, so there is nothing
    to be stale.

    A zero-interval single-shot timer was written first, to coalesce the decision
    to after the layout pass, and it is not here because it was measured to do
    nothing once `_owed()` stopped reading stale numbers: replacing it with a
    direct call left every test green, including the one that counts folds per
    restyle. `_settling` is the guard that remains, and it is a different job --
    telling the log to fold asks for a layout, and the layout asks here again.

    for its full 240px was a quarter of the tab's height spent on nothing.

    Folded rather than hidden: the strip with the handle, the elapsed field and
    the Stop button stays on screen, so the panel is where it was when a job does
    start. It unfolds itself the first time a run starts -- a job's output is
    then worth the height -- and from that point it is capped at
    `LOG_SHARE_OF_THE_TAB`, so the list above it is never the thing that pays.

    **Nothing here is on a timer.** The panel changes height when a job starts or
    when the user uses the handle, and at no other moment: a log that folded
    itself away after a grace period would take the failure line off the screen
    of the reader who was reading it, and every test of that rule would be a test
    of a `QTimer` (T80).

    The floor under the cap is this panel's OWN `minimumSizeHint()`, re-read on
    every event that can change it rather than measured once. A cap taken in
    `__init__` is taken before the panel has a parent, and the theme it will be
    styled by is applied to the WINDOW (`apply_dadcraft_theme(window)` in
    `build_window`) before this object exists: measured 2026-09-16 in that order,
    the cap came out 152px against a minimum of 180, so the panel was drawn 148
    -- 32px under its own floor, with the text pane clipped -- and it stayed
    there, because the next restyle only happens if the window is resized to a
    NEW width and the app opens at the one the theme was already generated for.

        to `_DB_HEALTHY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` for health, and a GUI thread parked on
        that is a frozen window.

        The backup is a `mysqldump` through `docker exec` into the database
        container, so with the stack stopped -- the ordinary state of a server
        nobody is playing on, and the state a user is in when they press
        "Update the server to latest…" -- it answered *"<db> is not running, so
        there is no database to back up"* and nothing was backed up. Measured on
        the Vanilla box, 2026-09-16 (T64's live gate, `dbdown-*`): the
        recommended button failed on the first press.

        **The same seam the applier uses for direct SQL** (`apply.Applier.
        _start_the_database_for_direct_sql`, T7) and for the same reason: the
        world is never started, only the database, because what is wanted is a
        database process to talk to and not a server that will write over the
        rows being dumped.

        **The database is left as it was found.** `start()` answers whether it
        had to start anything, and only that answer runs `stop()`. Leaving it up
        would be defensible after an update -- the rebuild recreates the whole
        stack a few minutes later -- but this is ONE decision for both buttons,
        and after the plain Backup button there is no rebuild coming: a press
        that quietly left a stopped server's database running is a press that
        changed something the user did not ask about. So it is put back, in both
        places, and the update's own `recreate` stage starts what it needs.

        `finally` and not a tidy line at the end: a backup that fails half way
        through must not leave the container up either, and `MaintenanceError`
        is the ordinary way out of here.

        The owner's ask of 2026-09-15 -- "a update server to latest, with a
        warning and recommendation to take a backup before updating" -- as ONE
        question with three answers rather than a warning followed by a separate
        "back up first?". Two dialogs in a row is how a user learns to click
        through the first, and the first is the one carrying the warning.

        **The backup is chained, not awaited.** `services.backup` runs off the
        GUI thread through `_run()` -- it is a `mysqldump` of a live world and
        takes minutes -- so this method returns as soon as it is started and the
        update begins in `_backup_before_update_done()`. What that costs is that
        the return value means "a press started something", not "the update
        started"; what it buys is a window that is not frozen for the length of
        a dump.

        **The backup starts the database if it is down** (T76), through
        `_backup_with_the_database()` and not `services.backup` directly. An
        update is what somebody does to a server nobody is playing on, so the
        stack is normally stopped when this is pressed -- and the backup is a
        `docker exec` into the database container, which refused. The
        recommended button therefore failed on the first press of every stopped
        server until 2026-09-16.

        **A failed backup STOPS**, which is `dml wow update`'s rule
        (`BACKUP_FAILED "Safety backup failed -- update not started"`) and not
        wow-manage's, which offered a backup and continued regardless. Somebody
        who asked for a backup first asked for it because they want one before
        this runs, and "we could not take one, so we did the dangerous thing
        anyway" is the opposite of the answer they gave.

        **And it asks again afterwards.** `Backup saved to {path}. Update now?`,
        No by default. Minutes have passed, the answer is on screen, and the
        person is at a point where saying no costs nothing at all.

        Every answer is read through `said_yes()`/`ask_update_choice()`, never by
        identity: PySide6 6.11's static `question()` returns a plain `int` (T33),
        and `is` against the enum member was always False.

REBUILD_HISTORY = """FACT 4, established 2026-09-07 and overturned 2026-09-08.

Every `QPushButton` in `yulon/ui/` was listed on 2026-09-07 and none of them
rebuilt anything, while `_format_report` ended with

    ⚠ worldserver REBUILD required before this takes effect

for 20 of the 41 shipped manifests -- an instruction that sent its reader
hunting for a control that had never existed. Pressing Install again did not
help either: `catalog/native.py`'s `stage_build()` skips the compile whenever
`built_images()` answers true, and the image tag is derived from the install
folder's name, so adding a module to `modules/` cannot even change the tag
that would make the build stage notice.

The button was built on 2026-09-08 (`ControllerView.rebuild_server()`, the
Modules tab, over `StagedInstaller.rebuild()` with a forced compile). This
note is kept because the sentence is only honest while that control is
reachable, and `test_the_rebuild_sentence_names_a_button_that_is_really_on_the
_tab` is what holds the two together -- it reads the label off the widget and
looks for it in the report the user is shown."""

IMPORT_CONTROL = (
    "a Start deliberately skips AzerothCore's importer — it brings up only the three "
    "long-running services — and Repair refuses a database that is already complete, so "
    "nothing you have pressed so far has run it"
)
"""FACT 5, established 2026-09-07, and half of it was overturned on 2026-09-08.

`docker.apply_module_sql()` existed and was measured working on yulon-ubuntu
2026-09-07 — the same one-shot with `AC_UPDATES_ALLOWED_MODULES=mod-aoe-loot`
applied `aoe_loot_module_string.sql` and moved `acore_world.updates` 2967 → 2968
— but no widget called it, so this sentence ended "Yu'lon cannot finish this one
for you yet" and naming a control would have been the same fault as naming a
rebuild button.

The widget was built on 2026-09-08 (`ControllerView.apply_module_sql()`, the
`MODULE_SQL_BUTTON_LABEL` button on the Modules tab), so what stays true here is
only the first half: why the SQL is still sitting there after an install. The
next action is now a button, and the line quotes its label rather than
retyping it."""


def _pending_sql_lines(pending: Sequence[PendingSql]) -> list[str]:
    """One line per deferred SQL step, saying what is on disk and unapplied.

    Three shapes because `PendingSql.files` has three answers — but all three
    say NOT applied, and the empty one earned that the hard way. The first live
    run of this code (yulon-ubuntu, 2026-09-07, the real applier against
    `/home/user/wowserver`) installed `mod-aoe-loot` and resolved its manifest
    glob `data/sql/db-world/*.sql` to nothing at all. The draft line here read
    "nothing to apply", and it was false: that clone carries
    `data/sql/db-world/base/aoe_loot_module_string.sql`, one directory deeper —
    the very file FACT 1 watched the importer apply, moving `acore_world.updates`
    2967 → 2968 an hour earlier. Two sibling modules cloned the same minute put
    theirs straight in `db-world/` (mod-solocraft: 1 file; mod-transmog: 3, plus
    an `updates/` folder), so the layout is per-repository and the manifest's
    glob is Yu'lon's own bookkeeping, not the importer's rule — upstream's
    `UpdateFetcher.cpp:159-186` walks the module's `data/sql` tree itself and
    never sees that pattern. So "the glob matched nothing" means this app cannot
    count, NOT that the module has no SQL, and replacing one confident lie with
    a quieter one would have been the whole of this box's defect again.

def _format_report(report: ApplyReport) -> str:
    """The run, drawn so that every tick is something that happened.

    Two things were wrong with this function on 2026-09-07 and they are the same
    thing twice: it stated as fact what it had not checked, and it named a next
    action that does not exist.

    The ticks came from `ApplyReport.done`, and `apply.py` put its deferred SQL
    step in that list -- so the live applier reported `DONE: sql
    data/sql/db-world/*.sql -> world: left to ac-db-import on next start` over
    an install where the SQL was never applied and nothing was going to apply
    it. That half is fixed in `apply.py`; here it means `pending_sql` is drawn
    with the other mark and the other verb (see `_pending_sql_lines`).

    The closing line said a REBUILD was required, which on 2026-09-07 was true
    and useless: every `QPushButton` in `yulon/ui/` was listed that day and none
    of them rebuilt anything, so the sentence read as an instruction to press
    something that did not exist. It is an instruction again as of 2026-09-08,
    because the button it names was built -- `ControllerView.rebuild_server()`,
    one row below the report this line appears in -- and the label is read from
    `REBUILD_BUTTON_LABEL` rather than retyped, so a rename cannot leave the
    report pointing at nothing.

    It also said it for every C++ module and for nothing else, which is the
    right split by accident -- counted through `parse_manifest` on 2026-09-07,
    `build.rebuild` is true for 20 of the 41 shipped manifests, all of type
    `module`, and false for the other 21 (7 ale, 2 keg, 11 mod, and `mod-arac`).
    A data-only one really does work without a recompile, so "this needs a
    rebuild" and "restart to apply" are two different messages about two
    different halves of the catalog, and the report says which half this item is
    in rather than leaving the reader to infer it from the presence of a
    warning.

    The remove case still does not claim to know what went into the last build.
    The live run on yulon-ubuntu 2026-09-07 removed two modules that had been
    installed minutes earlier and never built, and a draft saying "its code was
    compiled into the worldserver" was false of both -- so it says which case
    would be bad rather than which case this is.

    Nothing here is asserted about the machine. Every claim is about this app's
    own code, which is the same code on Windows as on the Linux box the
    measurements were taken on -- deliberately, because the install the real user
    runs was built by the DML bash installer and this app has never been run
    against one of those.
