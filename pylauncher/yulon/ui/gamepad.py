"""Mouse-free directional navigation for the Yu'lon launcher (PySide6).

"Dadcraft" gamepad autonomy: the engine turns a D-pad + face buttons + shoulder
bumpers into full navigation of every panel, button, tab and input, with no
mouse. It is input-source-agnostic by design: every source decodes the physical
device into *logical* `Direction`/`Action` events and hands them to the one
`Navigator`, which is the only thing that moves focus.

Two sources ship, for the two ways a pad reaches Qt:

- `GamepadSource` reads the physical controller through SDL's **GameController**
  sub-API (`pygame._sdl2.controller`), NOT raw `pygame.joystick`. The controller
  layer consults SDL's `gamecontrollerdb.txt` to normalize *every* device — the
  Steam Deck's virtual Xbox 360 pad (Linux evdev), a wired Xbox pad (Windows
  XInput), and a Bluetooth controller on macOS (IOHID / Game Controller
  framework) — onto one semantic enum, so `CONTROLLER_BUTTON_A` is always
  "Submit" and the D-pad always navigates, with zero per-OS code. This is the
  fix for the macOS-Bluetooth-telemetry failure and the out-of-the-box Deck
  requirement: we read what Steam Input already assigns, never ask the user to
  remap.
- `KeyboardSource` stays as a zero-dependency fallback for desktop arrow-key
  use and keyboard-emulation, so a checkout without `pygame` still navigates.

`GamepadSource` imports `pygame` lazily and degrades to a no-op when it is not
installed or no controller is present (CI, a headless box), so a missing
dependency never stops the app from launching.

PySide6/Qt6 dropped the legacy `QtGamepad` module; `pygame` (SDL2) is the one
backend that covers all three target OSes — and only its `_sdl2.controller` API
(not the raw joystick API) provides the cross-device semantic mapping. SDL2
already ships on SteamOS, so the AppImage on the Deck does not bloat.

Architecture (style-guide §3/§5): this module owns *navigation mechanics only*.
It knows how focus moves and how a logical action becomes a focus shift or a
click; it knows nothing about Docker, servers, installs or manifests. The main
window composes it and connects its signals.

        screen, and one with none on screen is not a candidate (T175,
        `_visible_edges`); nor is a box that holds the focused widget.

        Among ahead candidates, in order (T175):

        1. A stop that shows inside the focused widget -- a module's row with
           the Modules list focused, whichever way the press goes: the box is
           entered before it is left, at the edge the press goes in by (its top
           for Down, `_entry_line`), by the rule of 2 among its own stops.
        2. The nearest row (Up/Down): of the candidates that start past the
           focused widget's leading edge, those that start before the nearest
           of them ENDS, so no row is ever wholly passed over, wherever its
           stops stand. In that row, the one sharing the focused widget's
           column, else the least far aside, then the best centred. Left and
           Right do the same with the nearest column, but only among the
           candidates that share the focused widget's row. With the focus in
           a scrolled list, stops in that list come first; from outside a
           list the pad can stop on, the list comes before the stops in it.
           Nothing on the row: the same from each box that holds the focused
           widget, innermost first, among the stops outside it.
        3. Nothing qualifies: the old rule, the candidate most nearly in line
           (smallest offset), then the nearest.

        The old rule alone let Down jump whole rows: from the Tuning tab's conf
        list at 960x640 it went to the full-width "Last action" strip at the
        bottom, 0 px off-centre, past the three conf buttons straight under the
