"""The Logs tab (T93): read what Yu'lon kept, and save one file to send when something is wrong.

Everything shown here has been through the redactor: the viewer, the copied
lines and the zip. The files on disk stay raw.

The tab reads nothing when it is built -- only when it is SHOWN (and on
Refresh). A window is built before a test has pointed `config_dir()` at a
scratch folder (`test_main.py`'s module-scoped window), and the first thing a
refresh reads is the credential store.

**Every read is a job, never GUI-thread work** (T93 review). A read lists the
credential stores and every install's conf folders, and an adopted server's
folder is a path under `wsl.localhost`: touching it boots a stopped distro, and
a server on an unplugged drive blocks for the OS timeout. So each read --
sources, known passwords, redactor, file tail, redaction -- runs through the
`JobRunner` as one `_read_logs()` call, and the viewer says `READING` until
it lands. Each read carries a generation number and only the newest one is
painted, so a slow read never overwrites a newer one. Each read also builds its
own redactor, so a password stored since the last read (a channel credential at
the end of an install) is masked when the next file is picked.

"Open log folder" opens `logs/` (runs and snapshots) and never the folder that
holds `yulon.log`: that one also holds `credentials/` and `db-secrets/` in
clear text, and a player who zips the folder they were shown must not be able
to send those (lead ruling, 2026-09-23). The app log reaches support through
the zip, redacted.
