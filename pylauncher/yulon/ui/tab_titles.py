"""What the controller tabs are called, when more than one of them exists.

The whole title used to be the game plus `server_dir.name`, and the leaf folder
is the one part of the path that repeats: the installer suggests the same name
to everybody, so a second server put on another disk gave the tab strip two
tabs reading "WoW WotLK — DadsMmoLab". The full path is not the answer either -
a tab is a few centimetres wide, and a path dump in it is unreadable at exactly
the moment it matters.

So the title carries the SHORTEST tail of the folder chain that no other open
install shares: one folder while nothing collides, two the moment something
does, and the whole path only if two installs somehow agree the whole way up.
That is a fact about the SET of open tabs, not about one path, which is why the
whole strip is re-titled whenever a tab is added - opening the second install
is what makes the first one's title wrong.
