"""Dadcraft Minimal — the slim, elegant Yu'lon UI theme (PySide6).

The brief is a *toned-down* reimagining of the classic Dadcraft motifs: heavy
stone, parchment and beveled gold filigree are abstracted into flat dark-slate
sheets with razor-thin amber trim and micro-borders. Nothing here is ornate; the
theme reads as a modern utility interface that merely remembers where it came
from. The tokens are:

- Warm charcoal sheets (`#14120E` window, `#201C16` panel, `#12100C` input),
  deliberately earth-tinted — not neutral gray — so the chrome harmonises with
  the gold/brass filigree the decorative widgets paint.
- A single muted amber accent (`#FFB000`) with two restrained derivatives
  (`#C98A0A` hairline, `#8A6510` deep) — no lemon-yellow, no neon quality hues.
- 1px borders and 3px radii everywhere. There is no four-sided bevel idiom and
  no multi-stop chrome gradient left in the sheet.
- State-driven pseudo-classes (`:hover`, `:pressed`, `:focus`, `:checked`,
  `:disabled`) carry the feedback, so the interface feels responsive without
  being loud.

Two hard-won constraints are baked into the generator below and must not be
reintroduced (see `pyplan/style-guide.md` §2/§8):

1. **Never use the `not()` pseudo-selector in QSS.** Qt's `QCss::Parser` has no
   negation combinator; a single occurrence makes `Parser::parse()` return false
   and Qt silently keeps only the rules *before* the failure point. The sidebar
   rail is therefore targeted by objectName (`QTabWidget#sidebar-tabs`), never
   by a negation.
2. **QSS cannot scale type relatively.** `em`, `%` and the CSS keywords all
   resolve to a fixed value, so every font size and touch-target floor is
   *generated* per window width by `_build_qss(scale)`.

   The four tile covers are NOT styled here on purpose. `DadcraftCampaignCard`
   paints its own backdrop, particles and hover lighting in `paintEvent`, and its
   own sheet makes the card itself transparent and borderless — a widget's own
   stylesheet wins over the application sheet, so any rule written here for
   `QFrame#catalog-tile-*` would be dead text. The tile art has exactly one
   owner: the decorations module. That sheet names the card by its id
   (T188 C1), so the buttons and labels inside it are styled from here. */
