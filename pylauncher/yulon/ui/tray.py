"""Yu'lon in the system tray (T540): it keeps running when its window is closed.

The owner's design (ticket T540): closing the window hides it, and the tray icon
says how the servers are -- plain, a green dot when a realm is online, an amber
ring while one starts or stops, a red dot when one needs attention (crash loop,
partly up). A left click opens the flyout, a right click the menu, and Quit
tray… is the one way out.

**One process, one status.** The tray is the same app with its window hidden,
not a second program, so the single-instance lock (T152) is still held and a
second launch still brings the window back (`main._bring_to_front` calls
`show()`). It reads what each Server tab already computed -- the realm badge's
word, which folds in T188's held "starting/stopping", T391's crash loop and
T451's "starting until ready" -- through the badge's own `status_changed`. No
timer here asks Docker anything.

**What the tray needs from the window** is a handful of attributes
`main.build_window()` puts on it: `yulon_controllers` (the live tabs),
`servers_changed` (a tab came or went), `yulon_open_launcher` (Play, T187),
`yulon_show_server_tab` and `yulon_show_logs`. The tray gives the window
`yulon_quit`, the one close that is never turned into a hide: the self-update and
the lost-lock exit call it.

**No tray** (`isSystemTrayAvailable()` False: GNOME without AppIndicator, a
Steam Deck in Game Mode, offscreen Qt): no icon, and closing quits exactly as it
did before this existed.
