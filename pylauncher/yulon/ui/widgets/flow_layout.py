"""A row of controls that wraps onto a second line rather than clipping (T83).

`QHBoxLayout` has one answer when a row of buttons is wider than the widget it
is in: it shrinks every button below its own size hint, and Qt then draws each
button's label cut off mid-word. Measured themed on the Modules tab at the 960px
`main.MINIMUM_WINDOW_SIZE`, before this existed: `Check for updates` was drawn
in 114px against the 144 it asked for and read `heck for update`, and
`Rebuild the server…` read `ebuild the server`. There is no warning, no
ellipsis and no tooltip -- the control simply lies about what it does.

So the row wraps. Every item keeps its own size hint and the ones that do not
fit go onto the next line, which costs one line of height and only at the
widths where the alternative was a cut word.

WRAPPING rather than an overflow menu, and the reason is what these particular
buttons carry. Four of the six on the Modules action bar are GREYED on an
ordinary install -- `Apply module SQL` where the game has no importer,
`Check for updates` where nothing is cloned, `Adopt as imported…` until the
database says `populated`, `Apply pending database updates…` for three of the
four games -- and each of them explains itself in a tooltip. Inside a
`QMenu` both facts move behind a press: the reader cannot see that the action is
dead until they open the menu, and on a touch screen (the Steam Deck is a
shipping target, `theme.TOUCH_TARGET_PX`) they cannot reach the tooltip that
says why at all. That is the same argument T75 made about the lock chips, and it
is decided the same way here. Wrapping also keeps every button a real widget in
the tab order, which is what `ui.gamepad`'s D-pad walk enumerates.

One exception, and it is the owner's (T89, 2026-09-27): Rebuild and T64's two
presses are one "Server build ▾" button with a menu, because the three are one
act -- compile this server -- and seven buttons wrapped the bar at the 1280x800
the app opens at. What the menu costs is paid where it can be: the button greys
when no entry it shows can act, so "dead" is still readable without a press,
and `ui.gamepad` hands an open menu its own keys so the pad can walk it.

    """A widget holding a `FlowLayout`, that re-states its height when it wraps.

    `resizeEvent` is the half that is easy to leave out and easy to MEASURE as
    dead. A parent `QBoxLayout` works out its children's minimums when it is
    invalidated and re-uses them until something says they have moved -- and a
    plain resize says nothing. `FlowLayout.minimumSize()` answers for the width
    the layout was last GIVEN, so without this the bar reports its new minimum
    and the tab it is in goes on being laid out against the old one: measured on
    the Modules tab, resized 1400 -> 960 with no restyle, the bar said 106 while
    the tab's `minimumSizeHint()` stayed at the 376px it had with the bar on one
    line, instead of 432.

    It reads as dead code through any test that goes through
    `apply_dadcraft_theme()`, because a restyle invalidates every layout on the
    window and the parent re-asks anyway -- which is what most drags do
    (`main._Window._restyle_for_width`) and what every themed test here does. It
    was deleted once on exactly that evidence. The test that holds it down
    resizes without a restyle
    (`test_a_wrap_reaches_the_tabs_own_minimum_without_a_restyle`).

    Guarded on the answer CHANGING and not on the resize itself:
    `updateGeometry()` asks for a layout pass, a layout pass resizes this
    widget, and an unguarded call is that loop with nothing to stop it.

    One thing that looks as though it belongs here is deliberately absent, and
    it was written first: `QSizePolicy.setHeightForWidth(True)`. Every account
    of flow layouts says a parent asks for `heightForWidth()` only when the
    child's policy declares one, and that is the rule for a widget with NO
    layout -- `QWidget::hasHeightForWidth()` answers its layout's when it has
    one. Mutating the whole `setSizePolicy()` call away leaves every test here
    green. The vertical `Minimum` is kept on purpose: this bar's hint is a floor
    and not a target, so a column with height to spare spends it on what is
    under the bar, which on the Modules tab is the module list (T73).
