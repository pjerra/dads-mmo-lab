"""Streaming log output widget (roadmap 4.1).

`LogPanel` shows the lines of a long-running job — an install, a rebuild,
`docker logs -f` — live, without blocking the UI thread. The job is any
`Iterator[str]` factory (e.g. `lambda: installer.run(options)` or
`lambda: runner.stream([...])`); it runs on a `QThread` inside a
`_StreamWorker` that emits `line(str)` and `finished(bool, str)` signals, and
the panel only connects to those. Call down / signal up (style-guide §5):
whoever owns the panel calls `run()`, the panel signals `run_finished` and
never reaches into the runner or into its parent.

        install script's lines raw and says so, and `docker.follow_logs()`
        streams the worldserver's own colour — confirmed in the real stream:
        `\\x1b[36m` on every `[mod-city-bots]` line, plus bracketed-paste
        `\\x1b[?2004h` around the console prompt. A QPlainTextEdit renders none
        of that, so the Console tab showed the escape sequences themselves on
        every coloured line, and the install panel would have too. The parser in
        `console.py` strips separately and must keep doing so — it reads the
        prompt out of the raw stream, long before anything is displayed
        (review, 2026-08-23).

        The stray-ESC removal is the second half: `strip_ansi()` only matches
        CSI sequences, so an `ESC(B`-style charset switch leaves the ESC byte
        behind, and that renders as a box glyph.

        **Each line is stamped, and the panel keeps following the bottom.**
        Both were asked for by the owner on 2026-09-03 while watching a real
        install: an hour of build output with no clock on it answers neither
        "when did this step start" nor "how long has it been going", and a
        panel that stops following makes the newest line the one you cannot
        see. The stamp is `HH:MM:SS +H:MM:SS` -- wall clock, then time since
        this run began -- so the cost of a stage is a subtraction the reader can
        do in their head, and a stalled install is visible as a clock that has
        stopped moving.

        **Following the bottom is conditional, and that is the whole design.**
        A panel that always jumps to the end cannot be read while it is
        running: scrolling up to look at the error that just went past yanks
        the reader back on the next line. So the position is measured BEFORE
        the append and restored only if it was already at the end -- scroll up
        and the panel holds still; scroll back down and it resumes on its own,
        with no button and nothing to remember.

        The stamp is applied here, at the one place every source arrives,
        rather than at the yield sites: the install engine's lines are also the
        gate transcripts and the fixtures dozens of tests compare literally, and
        a timestamp in those would make every one of them a clock-dependent
        test. `text()` returns what is displayed, stamps and all.

        **Every line is classified, and one kind of line is not a line at all.**
        `lines.parse()` answers what arrived, and T35's three answers about
        appearance follow from it: the engine's own stage lines are bold, a
        relayed subprocess's are dimmed, and a warning or a failure is painted.
        A `progress` line is NOT appended — it is a reading that replaces the
        last one, so it goes to the header strip and nothing else. The T30
        install on yulon-arch wrote 97 minutes of `[Map 230] Building tile
        [32,32] (08 / 12)` into this panel at the weight of a sentence; that
        torrent is now one moving bar.

        `text()` therefore returns the DISPLAY text, prefixes off, which is why
        every test in this file that reads it passed unchanged through T35.

        This used to be `thread.finished.connect(worker.deleteLater)` - the
        textbook Qt pattern, and it is the segfault. `deleteLater` posts the
        delete to the object's OWN thread, and Qt runs it inside that thread's
        final cleanup (`QThreadPrivate::finish`) - on the worker thread.
        `_StreamWorker` is a Python subclass, so tearing it down needs the GIL.
        If the GUI thread holds the GIL at that instant and is inside Qt's
        connection mutex - delivering a signal into a Python slot, which is
        most of what a GUI thread does - each side holds what the other needs.

        gdb on yulon-ubuntu, 2026-08-28: the main thread in
        `cleanOrphanedConnectionsImpl` -> `QBasicMutex::lockInternal`, reached
        from a slider `rangeChanged` into a Python slot; a thread named
        "QThread" in `~QObject()` -> `Shiboken::GilState::acquire`. That is the
        deadlock. The same race that does not deadlock corrupts memory instead:
        9 of 20 GUI-only runs died with SIGSEGV or SIGBUS, always at the
        boundary where one test module's last worker finished while the next
        module's fixture was building a window. Removing `processEvents()` from
        that fixture's teardown changed nothing, which is how the suspect moved
        from the fixture to here.

        And the panel already held `self._worker`, so the deferred delete was
        destroying the C++ side of an object Python still pointed at.

        Deleting from the GUI thread is safe once the worker's thread has
        finished: an object whose thread is gone has no affinity, and Qt permits
        its destruction from any thread. `running` is false to reach here, and
        `wait()` turns "not running" into "fully exited" rather than "about to".
        The QThread object itself lives on the GUI thread - it was created here -
        so ITS deferred delete is a GUI-thread event and is fine.
