"""Ask a manifest's own questions before its item is applied (Lane A, 2026-09-07).

Two of the 41 shipped `wow-wotlk` manifests carry a prompt with no default —
`mod-ah-bot` and `mod-ah-bot-plus`, both of which want the GUID of the auction
house bot's character — and until this existed the Modules tab called
`Applier.install()` with no `values` argument at all. `apply._values()` then
filled in only the prompts that HAD a default, `_render()` raised on the one
that did not, and what the owner's screenshot read was:

    install mod-ah-bot-plus FAILED: conf AuctionHouseBot.GUIDs: no value for {bot_guid}

after the module had already been cloned onto his disk. So the two modules he
could actually test were the two the GUI could not install.

`ManifestPromptDialog` is deliberately more than a `QInputDialog.getText()`:
the manifest declares a *kind* per prompt (`int`, `float`, `bool`, `choice`,
`string`), and a text box that accepts anything would hand the applier an
answer it can only refuse later. The kind decides the control, and
`apply.check_answer()` — the SAME function the applier's own pre-flight uses —
decides whether OK can be pressed at all. One rule, one place, two callers.

The dialog holds the answers in a dict rather than reading them back off the
widgets. That is what lets `set_answer()` state a value a control cannot
display (a `bool` answered `"maybe"`, a `choice` answered `""`) and have the
dialog say so, rather than silently rounding it to whatever the combo box
happened to be showing.
