"""The Modules tab's surface: what this install HAS, then what it could have (T42).

Two things live here, and the split is the point.

`build_module_rows()` is a pure function: manifests in, `ModuleRow`s out, no Qt
anywhere near it. Everything the tab decides -- which family a row belongs to,
whether it is installed, whether it owes a rebuild, whether removing it would
break something else -- is decided there and is testable without a
`QApplication`. `ModulesPanel` draws what it is given and presses buttons; it
decides nothing.

The shape it draws is the DML launcher's `ModuleManager.svelte` in Yu'lon's own
theme (T42's mockup, approved by the owner 2026-09-12): a card per family, the
installed half first with a count, the rest behind an "Available N -- not
installed" toggle that starts collapsed when the family has anything installed
and open when it has none.

T41 is what made any of this possible and its accounting is MOVED here rather
than copied: `apply.CLONE_DIRS` gives ale and keg one directory, so a keg's
clone is read into both families' sets, and a name is accounted for per clone
FOLDER. Reading it per family listed `bmah` twice on the owner's own install
(measured 2026-09-12).

Nothing in this module imports `yulon.ui.controller_view`, and nothing imports
the decorations modules: upstream `Yulon` carries Baerthe's passes on those and
`dadcraft_decorations.py` there (T42; upstream has since renamed it from
`warcraft_`). Colours come from the `COLOR_*` constants `theme.py` exports.

    row DROPS chips in when they do not fit its width:

    1. the OWED chips, which name work somebody still has to do;
    2. the LOCK chips, which say why Install cannot be pressed at all (T55, T69);
    3. the remaining facts, which only explain the row.

    The lock chips moved ahead of the other facts in review: on a 1280x800
    handheld -- the Steam Deck, which is a shipping target and has no hover --
    `battlepass` showed `needs the client folder` and hid
    `needs AzerothCore Lua Engine (ALE), not installed` behind the overflow
    mark, so the one sentence saying why the button is dead was in a tooltip a
    touch user cannot open. A lock is the last fact to go.

    **The update chip is offered only where a press can run it (T146).** A
    catalogued row's is `Applier.update()`, the per-module pull. A row with no
    manifest has no steps for the applier, and its chip used to carry the same
    `update` anyway: on WotLK that was `mod-playerbots`, which the SERVER install
    clones, and a player who pressed it was told "Nothing was changed"
    (`controller_view.UNCATALOGUED_PRESS`). Now `server_update` says the caller
    found the folder among the checkouts "Update the server to latest…" moves,
    and the chip names that press and runs it; any other uncatalogued row gets
    no update chip at all. Check for updates still counts every folder and its
    report still prints them -- only the promise of a press is withdrawn.

    `manifests` is this game's catalog in ITS own order (the store's, family by
    family); `installed` is `apply.installed_clones()`'s answer, ids per family
    read from each family's own clone directory.

    The order is: family by family in `FAMILY_FILES` order, and inside a family
    the installed rows first in catalog order, then the rest in catalog order,
    then the clones no manifest matched. "Installed first" is the whole of T42's
    first line -- a user who adopted a server he already ran reads the top of
    each card and sees what he has.

    `unfinished` is `apply.unfinished_clones()`'s answer, in the same shape and
    read from the same folders (T68). It is a SUBSET of `installed` -- both
    walk the clone directories -- and it is passed separately rather than folded
    in because the two facts are different questions with different remedies,
    and every reader of `installed` today means "the folder is there".

    Since T121 `installed` is `apply.installed_modules()`: the folders, plus the
    sourceless mob multipliers whose answers-file record says they are in the
    database. `unknown` is `apply.unknown_modules()`, the ones nobody can say are
    in the database or not -- a press stopped on mid-statement, or an answers
    file that cannot be read -- with why; such a row reads `State unknown` and
    offers Remove, and an alternative locked by it says the doubt, not "is
    installed here" (fix wave).

    `server_updated` is where "Update the server to latest…" moves a checkout on
    this install, as `native.server_update_dests()` answers it, and empty or
    `None` where the install offers no such route (T146). It decides one thing:
