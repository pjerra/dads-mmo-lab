"""The QSS the Modules and Tuning tabs share (T44 item 6).

One module and not two copies of a string, because the two tabs are meant to
look like one surface: the owner's note on the press was "I want all the info
that was on this one, and same look", then "same with tuning", and a bevel
spelled twice is a bevel that can come to differ.

**Every colour here comes from `theme.py`'s `COLOR_*` constants and T44 forbids
inventing one.** That is not a style preference: `theme.py` is Baerthe's and
upstream carries its own passes on it, so a hex value typed here would be a
second palette to keep in step with a file this branch may not touch.
`test_the_panel_qss_invents_no_colour` reads every `#rrggbb` out of the sheet
and fails on one the theme does not export.

What it changes, and the whole of it:

* **The notch.** `theme.py` draws a `QGroupBox` title at `top left`; the
  mockups draw it centred over the top edge. Scoped to the two card object
  names rather than to `QGroupBox`, so the Modules tab's own "A module this app
  does not ship" box -- a sibling of the panel, not a card -- keeps the app's
  ordinary notch.
* **The bevel.** `theme.py`'s buttons are a flat sheet with one hairline. These
  get a lit top-left and a shadowed bottom-right, inverted while pressed. The
  total border thickness is 3px vertically in BOTH states on purpose: the
  theme's own comment on `QPushButton:pressed` records that a padding shift
  there once stopped a pressed button lining up with its neighbours, so the
  box must not change size -- only the content moves, which is what makes it
  read as a press.
* **The red edge (T193).** A sheet set on the panel outranks the window's,
  whatever the selectors, so the bevel above would also paint over the theme's
  `danger` border. A `danger` button here (Modules' Remove) gets
  `COLOR_DANGER` on all four sides back, and a disabled one the muted
  `COLOR_BRASS_DEEP` the theme gives it -- red on a button that cannot be
  pressed would be the opposite lie.
