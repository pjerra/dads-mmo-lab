"""Ask the user for a line of input on behalf of a subprocess (roadmap 6.1.5).

Docker provisioning runs `sudo`, and `sudo` asks for a password; the
docker-group join asks for consent. No rule can answer either — only the
person sitting at the machine can — so before this existed the install simply
stopped on the prompt and the window looked frozen.

The awkward part is which thread is which. The installer runs on a worker
thread (the window must not freeze during a two-hour install), but a dialog may
only be created on the GUI thread. `InputPrompter.ask()` is therefore called
*from the worker*, hands the question to the GUI thread through a queued
signal, and blocks until the answer comes back — which is exactly the
behaviour the subprocess needs, since it is sitting on a read.

Style-guide §3/§5: the write to the child's stdin lives in `runner.py`; this
only supplies the text. It never touches the subprocess.
