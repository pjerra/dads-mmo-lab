"""The Tuning tab's surface: every module setting, with the file behind it (T43).

T42's split, kept: the first half of this module is pure, so what the tab
DECIDES — which control a key earns, what a card costs to apply, what counts as
changed — is decided without a `QApplication` and is testable as data. The
widgets below draw what they are handed and press buttons; they decide nothing,
and they read and write nothing. `yulon.tuning` owns the disk.

**The safety rule runs through every choice here.** `control_kind()` gives a key
with no `type` a TEXT BOX, never a switch and never a spinner, and gives an
`int` with anything less than both bounds a text box too — a spinner cannot
exist without a range, and a range invented here would refuse values the module
is perfectly happy with. `starting_value()` never fabricates: a key the file
does not carry shows its default with a note SAYING it is not in the file, so
nobody reads a placeholder as a setting.

Nothing here imports `yulon.ui.controller_view` or any decorations module;
colours come from the `COLOR_*` constants `theme.py` exports.
