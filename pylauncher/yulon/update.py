"""Application self-update check (README §10, roadmap 5.4): check, notify, and ask.

Asks the GitHub Releases API which `-Public` release is newest, compares it with
the running `yulon.__version__`, and returns a typed `UpdateCheck` the UI turns
into a quiet banner and a what's-new dialog. Nothing is downloaded or replaced
here — "Update now" opens the download page (T90 plan 2); the swap is plan 3.
The HTTP call is a seam, so the check is unit-testable offline, and every
failure (offline, rate-limited, odd tag) degrades to "no update known", never to
a crash at launch.

Only a tag spelled `v1.2.3-Public` counts. This repository's release feed also
carries the test builds (`-fixtest`, `-DeckTest`) that the gates are cut from,
and until T90 the check compared the numeric triple alone — so whatever anyone
had tagged most recently was offered to every player as their next version.

    **Major and minor are whole numbers. The LAST number is read by a HYBRID
    rule** (owner, 2026-10-11, which amends the decimal rule of 2026-09-21):

    * **Before 0.9 it is a decimal fraction of its digits.** `65` is 65/100 and
      `7` is 7/10, so `.6 < .65 < .66 < .69 < .7`, and `.7 == .70` — equal,
      therefore not newer.
    * **From 0.9 on it is a whole number.** `.9 < .10 < .16`, so `0.9.9 <
      0.9.10 < 0.9.16`, and `0.10.9 < 0.10.10`. Baerthe's releases since 0.9
      count up this way (0.9.13, .14, .15, .16), and no new duty falls on him.

    The decimal half is what this project's early tags MEAN, and the
    measurement is the tag dates: `v0.8.7-Public` was cut on **2026-09-19**,
    after `v0.8.65-Public` on **2026-09-13**. The whole history reads the same
    way —

        0.6.5 → 0.6.51 → 0.6.52 → 0.6.53 → 0.6.55 → 0.6.57 → 0.6.58 →
        0.6.59 → 0.8.0 → 0.8.4 → 0.8.5 → 0.8.6 → 0.8.65 → 0.8.7

    — and the fork's `-fixtest` tags .66 .67 .68 .69 sit between .65 and .7.
    Compared as integers 65 > 7, so nobody running 0.8.65 or 0.8.66 would ever
    be offered 0.8.7; and picking the newest BY VERSION made that worse than
    the first-in-feed rule it replaced, because it actively named v0.8.65 the
    newest release in a feed that had v0.8.7 in it.

    The bump that proves the decimal half is upstream's own: commit `3534587b`
    sets `__version__ = "0.8.70-Public"` and its tag is **`v0.8.7-Public`**. To
    the person cutting the release those are one release, which is exactly
    what `.7 == .70` says — and it is why a build calling itself
    `0.8.70-Public` is correctly offered nothing (measured: `current=0.8.70-Public
    latest=v0.8.7-Public newer=False`).

    **Why the decimal rule could not go on past 0.9 (T669).** Read as a
    decimal, `.10 == .1 < .9`: a feed holding v0.10.0 to v0.10.10 named
    v0.10.9 the newest, so a player on 0.10.10 was offered v0.10.9 as an
    update — a downgrade the self-updater would install — and a player on
    0.10.1 was never offered 0.10.10. A stray `v0.9.2-Public` outranked 0.9.16.
    Both are wrong as whole numbers, which is how the releases are counted.

    The boundary needs no special care in the key: it is a tuple, so
    `(0, 8, …) < (0, 9, …)` whatever the last numbers are (0.8.90 < 0.9.0 <
    0.9.13). The third part is a `Fraction` on both sides of it so every key
    stays comparable with every other. A launcher built before this change
    reads 0.9.17 to 0.9.99 the same way; once one minor holds both X.Y.9 and
    X.Y.10 it needs two hops (to X.Y.9, which carries this rule, then X.Y.10).

    `Fraction`, never a float: `0.65` and `0.7` are both inexact in binary, and
    an ordering that decides releases may not be decided by a rounding.

    **A leading zero is meant literally below 0.9:** `.05` is five hundredths,
    so `0.8.0 < 0.8.05 < 0.8.1`. From 0.9 on `0.9.05` is simply 5.

    What `_VERSION` refuses — a fourth number, a tenth digit — is refused
    rather than read as something smaller; its docstring has each case.

    There is deliberately no second ordering in this module. The triple-valued
    `parse_version()` this replaces is gone rather than kept beside it: two
    orderings that disagree about `0.8.7` is the defect, not the fix.

    **Checking a clock between reads is not a bound**, which the third cold
    review measured against a real socket server trickling one byte every half
    second (2026-09-21): with a 2 s deadline, a plain body ran 12.0 s, a chunked
    body 12.0 s, and trickled HEADERS 12.0 s and then *returned an answer*. Two
    reasons, and the unit test could see neither, because it faked a response
    object whose `read()` returns immediately:

    * `http.client`'s `read(n)` blocks until it has n bytes or the stream ends,
      so a byte at a time never reaches the check between reads; and
    * the header phase is inside `urlopen`, which had not returned yet — the
      old code computed its deadline *after* it did.

    So the clock starts before `urlopen` and this shuts the socket down from
    another thread when it expires. `shutdown(SHUT_RDWR)` and not just
    `close()`: closing a socket another thread is blocked in does not reliably
    wake it.

    **This is one of two halves, and each was measured doing a different job.**
    Against the same trickling server with a 2 s deadline:

    * with the watchdog disabled, `body` and `chunked` still stopped at 2.0 s
      (`_read_bounded`'s `read1()` returns what has arrived, so the clock
      between reads is consulted) but `headers` ran the server's full length
      and returned success — the header phase is inside `urlopen`;
    * with `read1()` swapped back to `read()`, `headers` stopped at 2.0 s and
      `body` ran **8.0 s**: a shutdown did NOT wake that blocked `read`, which
      only returned when the server itself stopped.

    So neither alone bounds every shape, and the per-socket `timeout=` under
    both is what covers a server that goes completely silent. All three are
    pinned by `test_a_real_server_that_trickles_is_cut_off_at_the_deadline`.

    `fired` is what the caller checks afterwards, because a shut-down socket
    makes a read answer "end of stream" — an empty, apparently complete body,
    which is exactly how the header case managed to report success.

    **Unproved: Windows.** Whether `shutdown()` from another thread wakes a
    recv blocked inside OpenSSL on Winsock has not been measured — every
    number above is Linux, and the reviewer's HTTPS run was Linux too. If it
    does not, the per-operation `timeout=` still applies there, so the worst
    case on Windows is the old behaviour rather than a hang: a trickle that
    beats the 5 s socket timeout holds the launch thread. Worth a Win11 gate
    before anyone claims the bound is cross-platform.

**What this cap actually buys, measured through the real widget** (this dev
box, 2026-09-21; the seventh cold review's box was up to 4x slower on the same
shapes, so read these as the floor). Four sections, each a full 16 KB of the
worst thing that shape can be:

    20-column table    0.37 s      one paragraph      0.01 s
    one-column table   0.31 s      images             0.07 s

    headings           0.08 s      10,000 releases    0.01 s

**Two boxes, and both numbers are recorded rather than the friendlier one.**
The 0.37 s above is this dev box's whole cost for the 4x16 KB 20-column table.
The reviewer's laptop measured the same shape as **1.72 s to build the document
and 0.61 s to show it** — six times as long, on hardware a player may well be
running. The cap is set for the slower of the two and the faster one is not the
claim.

That is a one-off stall while the dialog opens, on hostile input at the cap,
and it is accepted. **Do not raise this without re-measuring**: the cost is
Qt's layout, it is not linear in the character count, and a table is the shape
that grows fastest.

Counted in CODE POINTS, which is not what Qt counts: 16,384 astral characters
are 32,768 UTF-16 units to `QTextDocument`. The cap is therefore a bound on
what is parsed rather than an exact bound on what Qt holds.

Nothing in this app can make `QTextDocument` faster at those, so it is handed
less. Counted in CHARACTERS rather than bytes because that is what the layout
cost scales with.

This one is a budget over WHOLE releases and never cuts inside one: releases
are taken newest first while the running total fits, and the rest are left out
with `notes_cut` set. The newest is always taken — it is already inside
`MAX_BODY_CHARS`, and it is the release the banner is about. The dialog says

    **Markdown-blind, and that is the fix.** Every version of this before the
    sixth cold review had to know where a fenced block began and ended, because
    the cut text was about to be glued to the next release's notes and an
    unclosed fence would swallow them. Five defects came out of that one
    decision, and the last three could not be fixed by a better fence parser:
    md4c closes a fence when the LIST holding it ends, treats U+00A0 after a
    closer differently from a space, and reads `#123 fixed` as a paragraph
    where a `startswith("#")` rule read a heading.

    Nothing here has to agree with md4c any more. Each body is parsed on its
    own and rendered into its own document (`update_dialog._NotesView`), so a
    fence this leaves open ends with that release's document and reaches
    nothing. The only job left is the size bound, which is a fact about

    Whole lines are kept, so the last thing shown is a whole line — except for
    a single line longer than the whole limit, which is cut into it, because
    there is no boundary to prefer inside one line and the bound is the point.
    Idempotent: what comes back is within the limit, so capping it again
    returns it unchanged.

    Splits on `"\n"` only. A lone `\r` is not a line break here; GitHub sends
