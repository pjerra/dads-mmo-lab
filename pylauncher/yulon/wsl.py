"""Finding WoW servers that live inside a WSL2 distro.

A server built by the DML Launcher runs on Docker CE *inside* a distro, not on
Docker Desktop on the Windows side. Yu'lon is replacing that launcher, so those
servers have to be adoptable rather than merely refused — see
`pyplan/wsl-resident-servers.md` for the design and the spike behind it.

**Discovery asks Docker, not the filesystem.** `docker compose ls` already knows
every project and the exact path of its config files, so nothing here scans for
`~/games/*` or parses another product's folder conventions. That is what keeps
Yu'lon uncoupled from the DML Launcher's layout: it can reorganise freely and
this module never notices.

Windows-only in practice. Every entry point answers "nothing found" off Windows
rather than raising, because a caller asking what is available does not want an
exception for the ordinary case of there being nothing.

    """Why a docker command inside `distro` failed, if the distro itself is gone.

    A remembered distro can be deleted or renamed under a server that was
    adopted out of it, and what the user was shown for that was the raw failure:
    `docker ps exited 4294967295: ` - with nothing after the colon, because
    **wsl.exe writes this complaint to stdout, not stderr**, and stderr is what
    `docker._run()` quotes. Captured 2026-08-26:

        rc     : 4294967295
        stdout : 'T\\x00h\\x00e\\x00r\\x00e\\x00 \\x00i\\x00s\\x00 ...'
        stderr : ''

    The NULs are not damage: wsl.exe writes UTF-16LE, and `runner.run()` decodes
    as UTF-8, so every ASCII character arrives followed by `\\x00`. Matching
    survives that by removing them rather than by re-decoding, because the caller
    has already lost the bytes.

    **Why the translation lives here and not at the seam that raises.** There
    are several of those seams, all in `docker.py`: `_run()` for buffered calls,
    `follow_logs()` and `run_attached()` for the streamed ones, and
    `volume_exists()`, which reads its own exit codes rather than going through
    `_run()` because the answer it wants IS a non-zero exit. A missing distro
    fails at every one. Putting the knowledge of wsl.exe's exit codes and
    UTF-16 output in each of them would spread this module's traps across the
    file that already carries the most review history. Every one of those seams
    already holds a `wsl_distro`, an exit code and the captured output, so this
    signature is what each needs to ask in one line, with no new parameter
    threaded anywhere.

    The list is *named*, not counted. It said "three" until `volume_exists()`
    became the fourth, and a bare number in another module's docstring has
    nothing that can notice; the names do, because
    `test_every_seam_that_asks_about_a_missing_distro_is_named_where_it_is_answered`
    reads the callers out of `docker.py`'s AST and requires each to appear here.

    `distro` is `str | None` for the same reason: the seams hold exactly that,
    and a plain Windows docker failure has no distro to blame, so it is None
    here rather than an `if` at each call site.

    Two-tier on purpose. The error code settles it without spawning anything.
    Whether every wsl.exe build prints that code could not be captured here -
    only this box's was, and inventing the older one's output is exactly what
    this module's fixtures refuse to do - so a failure that does not carry it
    asks the listing instead. Asking the listing does not start any distro,
    unlike probing one (see `find_servers()`), and it only happens on a path
    that has already failed.

    **An EMPTY listing is not evidence of anything.** `_wsl_list()` answers `()`
    for four different things - no wsl.exe on PATH, `OSError`, a timeout, and a
    non-zero exit - and only one of them means "there are no distros". The
    condition that sends a failure down to tier 2 is a `0xFFFFFFFF` carrying no
    `WSL_E_DISTRO_NOT_FOUND`, which is WSL failing at the SERVICE level
    (LxssManager wedged, vmcompute down) - and that is exactly the state in
    which `wsl -l -q` also fails and returns `()`. Reading that silence as "the
    distro is gone" sent the user off to re-adopt a server that was never
    missing, in precisely the case tier 2 exists to judge (review, 2026-08-26).
    So the accusation needs a listing that ANSWERED and did not name the distro;
    anything else stays quiet and lets the raw failure through, which is
    unhelpful but true.
