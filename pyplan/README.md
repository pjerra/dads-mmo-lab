# Dad's MMO Lab — Unified Launcher (PySide6)
## Project "Yu'lon" - The Great Serpent

> Planning & execution document for replacing the shell-script install workflow with a cross-platform desktop application. This revised plan outlines how we can build a better, easier to maintain, system for managing our offline server installers all the while minimizing our reliance on platform-specific scripting and ensuring a consistent user experience across all supported platforms. This will also help us stay within the legal boundaries of software distribution of this kind.

---

## Document map (where each planning doc lives)

There are **three `README.md`s**, each with a distinct audience, plus three `pyplan/` companions with a deliberate division of labour:

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `README.md` (repo root) | Project landing page — license, ethos, and the guide index. |
| `pyplan/README.md` (this file) | **The design doc**: *what* to build and *why*. Precedence on architecture. |
| `pylauncher/README.md` | **User-facing**: what the shipped app does under the hood. |
| `pyplan/style-guide.md` | **The code rules**: *how* to write it. Precedence on style. |
| `pyplan/roadmap.md` | **The execution plan**: *what order* to do it in. Clean plan only — no decisions or notes. |
| `pyplan/phase6-decisions.md` | **The Phase 6 decisions log ("why")**: reasoning, rejections, incident history. |
| `pyplan/phase7-decisions.md` | **The Phase 7 decisions log**: one install engine for all four servers; what it overturns in the pages above, by name. |
| `pyplan/phase7-plans/` | **The Phase 7 implementation plans**, one per gated step (7.1, 7.2, 7.3 so far): bite-sized TDD tasks with the code, against the interface contract each plan embeds. Executed task by task; ticked in the checklist. |
| `pyplan/phase8-decisions.md` | **The Phase 8 decisions log**: so far one feature only — uninstalling an install, and what it deliberately does not touch. Written before Phase 8 is scoped; blocked on Phase 7. |
| `pyplan/checklist.md` | **The checkable progress tracker**: completed `[x]` / pending `[ ]` items per phase. |

**Precedence (restated once, here and in the other two):** `README.md` wins on *what/why*;
`style-guide.md` wins on *how*; `roadmap.md` wins on *order*. If they conflict, flag it — don't
silently pick one.

The division that matters most for drift control: **avoid putting a decision in the roadmap, avoid
putting narrative in the checklist, and avoid putting status in the design doc.** When content
starts to migrate, move it to the column above it, not into a fourth place.

## 1. Problem Statement

Dad's MMO Lab currently ships installers and managers as **Bash scripts** (`install-wow-wotlk.sh`, `wow-manage.sh`, `dml-start.sh`) and **PowerShell scripts** (`Install-DML.ps1`). This works for developers but is hostile to the target audience ("dad-friendly", zero Linux knowledge). This in turn has caused a lot of issues for our users and headaches for us. The scope of the project has moved beyond simple scripting to a full-fledged desktop application.

Goals:

1. **No user-facing shell.** Users click buttons, never touch Konsole/PowerShell/WSL — including networking (LAN & internet play) auto-setup (§13).
2. **One unified codebase.** Write once, run on macOS, Windows, and Linux (Arch/Debian/Fedora/Bazzite/SteamOS).
3. **Catalog + Controller.** A catalog of installable servers ("Catalog") that holds the users hand tightly, and a per-install management surface ("Controller").
4. **Data-driven module/mod management.** Modules and mods become JSON manifests fetched from GitHub, so adding content is a data-entry task, not a code task.
5. **The app installs everything.** Every dependency is silently installed and verified by the app — including **Docker itself** (Docker Engine on Linux, Docker Desktop on Windows/macOS), the **virtualization layer it needs** (WSL2 on Windows, the Linux VM on macOS), the open-source emulator server (cloned from its official repo), any modules/mods, and even the app's own runtime. The user never installs anything by hand — not Docker, not WSL, not Python. See §3a (what the app may and may not install) and §3b (how the platform dep stack, Docker, WSL/VM, and Python are each handled).

**v1 scope — four servers.** Until v1 is complete, the Catalog/Controller focuses on exactly four servers: **WoW** (Vanilla 1.12), **WoW TBC**, **WoW WotLK**, and **WoW Tortoise** (the Turtle-WoW solo fork). These are the only acronyms/`game` ids the v1 Catalog needs to know about; other games in the wider DML catalogue are explicitly out of v1 scope (README's planned/in-progress lists) and are only added after v1 ships. **This is a target, not current state** — all four are described in `catalog.json` (Phase 3.1), but only WotLK has a controller package; see §5's status note and `roadmap.md` §7.1–7.3 for the work that covers the other three.

---

## 2. Technology Decisions

| Concern | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Language | **Python 3.11+** | No JS, No Rust, No Bash; Python has a large FOSS community and is easy to learn. Matches the existing Bash/PowerShell scripting DNA. Contributor-friendly. |
| UI toolkit | **PySide6 (Qt)** | Avoids the "ugly Python GUI" (Tkinter) reputation; native widgets, QSS styling, cross-platform. |
| Packaging | **PyInstaller** | De-facto standard; one binary per platform. Can be setup with GH Actions for automated builds. |
| CI | **GitHub Actions build matrix** | Required because PyInstaller cannot cross-compile — each platform builds on its own runner. |
| Docker interaction | **Docker CLI via `subprocess`** (not the Docker SDK — see style-guide §7) | 100% parity with existing scripts; `docker compose` semantics preserved. |
| Module & ALE catalog (for WotLK) | **JSON manifests** fetched from GitHub | Makes the controller extensible without code changes. |
| Modification Catalog (all servers) | **JSON manifests** fetched from GitHub | Makes the controller extensible without code changes. Focus on simple database and GM commands that can be run to modify the server. |

---

## 3. Critical Constraint: Docker Requires a Linux Kernel

The app drives Docker, which runs Linux containers (AzerothCore `ac-worldserver` is a Linux ELF).
There is **no native-Windows or native-macOS way** to run these containers. Therefore:

| Platform | What the app must silently provision |
|---|---|
| **Linux** (any distro) | Docker Engine directly — no virtualization layer needed. |
| **Windows** | Docker Desktop (WSL2 backend) — app installs/verifies both, user never sees "WSL". |
| **macOS** | Docker Desktop (runs a Linux VM) — app installs/verifies it. |

**Promise to users:** "Click install." — the app hides Docker/WSL/virtualization entirely.
**Reality to engineers:** the virtualization layer cannot be removed on Windows/macOS; it is only *hidden*.

**Runtime strategy:** use **Docker Desktop** as the container runtime on **both** Windows and
macOS — it already owns the Linux VM (macOS) and the WSL2 backend (Windows), so the app only
provisions Docker Desktop and drives `docker compose` against it. The kernel constraint is
satisfied by Docker Desktop itself; no bespoke VM/WSL2 manager is built. (Full rationale in
`pyplan/phase6-decisions.md`.)

This means the provisioning layer (`platform.ensure_docker()`) carries platform-specific "ensure
a Linux container environment exists" logic, but the **application code remains 100% shared** —
including the installer. From Phase 7 (`pyplan/phase7-decisions.md`; a target as of 2026-08-26,
landing step by step from 7.1) there is **one typed Python install engine for every server on
every platform**: a shared staged/resumable spine and
one engine per emulator family (AzerothCore for WotLK; CMaNGOS for TBC, Vanilla and Tortoise),
with every per-game fact in `catalog.json` and templates. The bash installers that Phases 3–6
wrapped on Linux are retired, one live gate at a time.

---

## 3a. Legal & Distribution Boundaries

The intro to this document promises the app helps "stay within the legal boundaries of software distribution of this kind." That promise must be enforced as a concrete rule on the Catalog/Installer design, matching the project's existing ethos (see root `README.md`: "open source emulators only — no copyrighted assets, no game files distributed"):

- **The app never downloads, bundles, or redistributes copyrighted game client files or assets.** The Catalog only ever installs: open-source emulator server software (cloned/pulled from its official repo), platform dependencies (Docker, its virtualization backend — see §3b), Docker images, and configuration. Nothing proprietary.
- **The user always supplies their own legally obtained client.** The installer's job is to *locate* an existing client install (or prompt the user to point at one / acquire one themselves) — never to fetch it on the user's behalf.
- **Manifests must not reference or link to piracy sources.** Any `repo` field in a module/mod manifest must point at a legitimate open-source project (e.g. `azerothcore/mod-ah-bot`), never a ROM/warez site.
- **This rule applies uniformly across all games in the Catalog**, not just WotLK — it should be checked as part of Phase 3's `installer.py` design and Phase 2's manifest schema validation (reject any manifest whose `repo` isn't an allowed source).

---

## 3b. Platform Dependencies Are Installed Automatically (Docker, WSL/VM, and Python)

Goal 5 (§1) says "the app installs everything." Concretely, this means all three layers of the
platform dependency stack are provisioned automatically, never by the user:

### Docker (the container runtime)

- **Linux (any distro):** the app installs **Docker Engine** directly (via the distro's package
  manager, e.g. `pacman`/`apt`/`dnf`), then verifies the daemon is running. No virtualization
  layer is needed on Linux.
- **Windows:** the app installs **Docker Desktop**, whose backend is **WSL2** — it silently
  provisions WSL2 first, then Docker Desktop, then verifies both. The user never sees "WSL".
- **macOS:** the app installs **Docker Desktop**, which runs the Linux containers inside a
  **Linux VM** that Docker Desktop manages itself.

### The virtualization layer (Windows/macOS only)

- This is a *consequence* of §3's kernel constraint — Linux containers can't run natively on
  Windows/macOS — so provisioning Docker Desktop already implies provisioning its VM/WSL2 backend.
  The app treats this as one silent, atomic "make containers work" operation, not a separate step
  the user must be aware of.

### Python (the app's own runtime)

- **End users never install Python.** Each distributable artifact (`.AppImage` / `.dmg` / the
  Windows zip, §4) is built with **PyInstaller**, which bundles a self-contained Python
  interpreter and all third-party packages (PySide6, etc.) alongside the launcher executable. On
  Linux and macOS that is one file; on Windows the zip unpacks to a folder the user runs
  `yulon.exe` from. No platform needs a `python3` install, `pip`, or a virtualenv.
- **The Python-install burden is shifted to the build machine, not the user.** Only the CI build
  runner (GitHub Actions, §4) needs a real Python toolchain; the shipped artifact carries what it
  needs.
- **This supersedes the developer-facing setup path** — `CONTRIBUTING.md`'s
  "`python3 -m venv .venv`" instructions exist *only* for contributors running from source; they
  are never part of the end-user experience.
- **If a platform can't bundle Python** (e.g. a future distribution format forbidding
  self-contained runtimes), the app falls back to *silently detecting and installing* the smallest
  available Python runtime the same way it provisions Docker — still no user-facing shell.

---

## 4. Package Targets (per platform)

| Platform | Artifact | Tooling | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| macOS | `.dmg` | PyInstaller | Built on `macos-latest` runner. |
| Windows | zipped one-dir build (`yulon.exe` + its runtime files) | PyInstaller | Built on `windows-latest` runner; `release.yml` zips `dist/yulon`. |
| Linux (all) | `.AppImage` | PyInstaller + `appimagetool` | **Hero artifact** — one file runs on Arch/Debian/Fedora/Bazzite/SteamOS. |

**Key insight:** the Linux `.AppImage` erases the distro matrix. Focus on appimage as it should run *fine* on most linux distros that people actually use.

---

## 5. Proposed Project Structure

> This reflects the structure actually scaffolded in `pylauncher/` (see repo). Each package has an `__init__.py`; manifests are indexed by a top-level JSON per category, with individual mod/module files added under `mods/` as Phase 2 data-porting work produces them (not created empty ahead of time).
>
> **Two naming fixes discovered during Phase 0 setup, applied and reflected below:**
> 1. The top-level package is `yulon/`, not `py/` — a package literally named `py` shadows the
>    third-party `py` PyPI package that `pytest` itself depends on internally, which crashes
>    pytest with `AttributeError: module 'py' has no attribute 'path'`. This is not a style
>    preference; it's a real, reproducible bug.
> 2. Per-game controller packages use underscores, not hyphens (`controller_wow_wotlk/`, not
>    `controller-wow-wotlk/`) — a directory name containing a hyphen is not a valid Python
>    package name and cannot be imported (`import controller-wow-wotlk` is a syntax error; `mypy`
>    also rejects it: "contains `__init__.py` but is not a valid Python package name"). This
>    corrects style-guide §6a's own kebab-case-for-non-Python-directories guidance, which didn't
>    account for the fact that these directories *are* real Python packages.

**Status as of this writing (2026-08-26):** the tree above shows the Phase 7 target; the
`families/` package, `install_wiring.py`, `catalog/installers/shared/` and the new tests do not
exist yet (nor do the client/SELinux facts in `preflight.py` or provisioning's use of
`runner.interact()`), and the six `install-*.sh` scripts still do. Only `controller_wow_wotlk/` exists.
Catalog entries exist for all four (Phase 3.1). What the other three v1 servers do **not** have is
controller packages or manifests; `manifests/` holds `wow-wotlk/` only. Phase 7
(`pyplan/phase7-decisions.md`) first makes every server *installable* through the one engine,
Linux first, then gives each its own `controller_<acronym>/` package (`controller_wow_tbc/`,
`controller_wow_vanilla/`, `controller_wow_tortoise/`) following the same file layout and
underscore naming — a controller needs a server to control. No server outside v1's four is
considered before that (see style-guide §6 for acronym conventions).

## 6. The Manifest Schema (for WotLK)

The entire project succeeds or fails on the module/mod manifest format. It must capture everything `wow-manage.sh` currently hardcodes as **data**, not code.

**Finalized in Phase 2.1** as the pydantic models in `pylauncher/yulon/manifest.py`; the
language-neutral JSON Schema is checked in at `pylauncher/manifests/schema/manifest.schema.json`
(regenerate with `python -m yulon.manifest --dump-schema`; a test fails if it drifts). One schema
serves all four families (`type`: `module` | `ale` | `mod` | `keg`) — the primitives are a closed
set (`source`, `build`, `sql`, `conf`, `deploy`, `patches`, `client`, `server_dbc`, `npcs`,
`prompts`, `notes`); unknown keys are rejected, ids/game are lowercase kebab slugs, and `source.repo`
must be a GitHub `owner/name` slug or an `https://` URL on an allow-listed forge (§3a). Every
field except `id`/`name`/`type`/`game` is optional — plus `source`, which `module`, `ale` and
`keg` items all require, and `source.sparse_path`, which a `keg` also requires — so a simple
module stays short:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "id": "mod-ah-bot",
  "name": "Auction House Bot",
  "type": "module",
  "game": "wow-wotlk",
  "description": "Populates the auction house with bot-posted items.",
  "source": {"repo": "azerothcore/mod-ah-bot"},
  "build": {"rebuild": true},
  "conflicts_with": ["mod-ah-bot-plus"],
  "sql": [{"db": "world", "path": "data/sql/db-world/*.sql", "applied_by": "db-import"}],
  "conf": [{
    "file": "env/dist/etc/modules/mod_ahbot.conf",
    "template": "conf/mod_ahbot.conf.dist",
    "keys": [
      {"key": "AuctionHouseBot.Account", "default": "{bot_account}"},
      {"key": "AuctionHouseBot.GUID", "default": "{bot_guid}"}
    ]
  }],
  "prompts": [
    {"key": "bot_guid", "question": "GUID of the bot character", "kind": "int"}
  ]
}
```

Per-category index files (`modules.json`, `ale.json`, `mods.json`, `kegs.json`) are
`{"schema_version": 1, "game": "wow-wotlk", "type": "module", "items": ["mod-ah-bot", ...]}` and
the per-item files live in the matching subdirectory (`modules/mod-ah-bot.json`, ...).

### Tacit knowledge to port (from `wow-manage.sh`)

> **Ported in Phase 2.2** — every item below now lives as data in `pylauncher/manifests/wow-wotlk/`
> (41 manifests; see `pyplan/checklist.md` Cross-cutting for the port record). Kept here as the
> statement of what the schema had to be able to say.

`wow-manage.sh` is ~2,300 lines with heavy embedded knowledge that must become manifest fields:

- **Module config key differences** — e.g. `AuctionHouseBot.GUIDs` (AH Bot Plus, plural) vs the original `AuctionHouseBot.GUID` (singular) + `Account` key. This kind of nuance must be explicit in the JSON.
- **SQL apply ordering** and glob patterns per module.
- **Build targets** — which modules require a worldserver rebuild vs. pure-SQL.
- **Dependencies** — e.g. `mod-player-bot-level-brackets` requires the Playerbots module to function (verified in `wow-manage.sh`; AH Bot has no such dependency — an earlier draft of this doc incorrectly used AH Bot as the dependency example).

## 8. Known Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Python packaging is painful | Standardize on PyInstaller + CI matrix from day one; treat AppImage as the only Linux artifact. |
| PyInstaller cannot cross-compile | Build matrix — each platform on its own runner. Never attempt local cross-builds. |
| Docker Desktop silent provisioning is fragile | Detect + verify with clear, retryable checks; offer manual-install fallback dialog. |
| Porting `wow-manage.sh` tacit knowledge | Do it as an explicit Phase 2 with exit criteria; don't fold it into the UI work. |
| "No WSL" expectation vs reality | Communicate honestly in docs (WSL is hidden, not removed). |
| Scope creep on bot-party/item-mail features | Kept in-game tools (My Party, item mail, teleport) out of Phases 1–7. Phase 8 scoped them on 2026-09-06, each with its own step and definition of done, and cut the ones with no console-legal mechanism (heal, summon, coordinate teleport) rather than inventing one — `pyplan/phase8-parity-decisions.md`. |
| Unsigned binaries trigger OS gatekeeper warnings (Windows SmartScreen, macOS Gatekeeper) | For v1, document the click-through steps for users. Revisit code signing/notarization once the project has a budget/identity for certificates; track as a post-v1 milestone, not a blocker. |

## 9. Out of Scope (v1)

Out of scope for the installer and controller work of Phases 1–7. The first three were deferred,
not refused, and are **no longer out of scope at all**: Phase 8 was scoped on 2026-09-06 and the
owner expanded them into v1, each with its own step and definition of done
(`pyplan/phase8-parity-decisions.md`; the boxes are `checklist.md` Phase 8). Kept struck through so
the reversal is visible.

- ~~**My Party / bot group builder**~~ — **no longer out of scope.** Expanded into v1 on
  2026-09-06 as step 8.6, WoW WotLK only (owner answers 2b and 4), by a server-side route: the
  launcher's own Lua bridge over the command channel, never an addon written into the user's
  client (answer 5). Browse Bots is step 8.5 on all four servers.
- ~~**Item database + in-game mail**~~ — **no longer out of scope.** Expanded into v1 on
  2026-09-06 as part of step 8.4 (owner answer 2a): item search is a database read, item mail is
  the server's own command, and the items-per-message cap is a per-tree fact — twelve on WotLK and
  TBC, one on Vanilla and Tortoise.
- ~~**Teleport / GM in-game tools**~~ — **no longer out of scope.** Expanded into v1 on 2026-09-06
  as the rest of step 8.4: named teleport, revive, set level, rename and mailed money, each drawn
  only on a server whose own command table has it. Teleport to raw map coordinates stays out,
  because it would need a direct write to the character database while the server runs, which
  owner answer 7 refuses.
- ~~**Full native reimplementation of installers on Linux**~~ — **no longer out of scope.**
  Overturned 2026-08-26 by the owner: Phase 7 puts every server on the one Python engine on every
  platform, Linux included, and deletes the bash installers (`pyplan/phase7-decisions.md`, "What
  this overturns, by name"). Kept here struck through so the reversal is visible.
- **Code signing / notarization** — accept OS gatekeeper warnings for v1; revisit later (see §8).

---

## 10. Application Self-Update

Users download this app directly (AppImage/exe/dmg) with no package manager tracking updates, so the app must check for new versions itself.

- On launch, check the GitHub Releases API for a newer tag than the running `__version__`.
- If found, show a non-blocking banner/dialog with a link/button to download the new artifact for the user's platform.
- **v1 scope:** check + notify only. Auto-download/auto-replace-the-running-binary is deferred — replacing a running AppImage/exe from within itself is fiddly per-platform and not worth the risk before the core app is stable.
- Revisit in-place auto-update once Phase 5 packaging is proven reliable.

---

## 11. Local Data & Config Storage

The app needs a per-OS location to persist its own state — remembered server install paths, last-used settings, cached manifests — separate from the server data itself (which lives under the user-chosen server directory, e.g. `~/wow-server-playerbots/`).

| Platform | Config/state directory |
|---|---|
| Linux | `~/.local/share/yulon/` (XDG Base Dir convention) |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\yulon\` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/yulon/` |

- Store: known install locations per game, chosen client paths, last-checked update version, cached copies of fetched manifests (with an ETag/timestamp for refresh).
- This directory is **not** the server directory — never conflate app state with server/database files. Server files stay wherever the user chose during install (matching existing script behavior, e.g. `choose_install_dir()` in `install-wow-wotlk.sh`).
- Owned by `platform.py` (add a `config_dir()` helper alongside `detect()`); implemented in Phase 1, consumed by Catalog/Controller from Phase 3 onward.

---

## 12. Single-Instance / Port Conflict Rule

Existing docs are explicit: **"Only run ONE server at a time — they share the same ports"** (`WoW-WotLK-CONTROLS-1.md`). The Controller must enforce this instead of silently reproducing the shell version's foot-gun:

- Before starting a server, the Controller checks whether the required ports (e.g. 3724, 8085) are free. It is one **global** scan of running containers for anything publishing them — so it also catches containers with nothing to do with Yu'lon — with this install's own three excluded by name. It does NOT enumerate other managed installs; this line said it did, and `port_conflicts()`'s own docstring says it "has no concept of which install a container belongs to".
- If a conflict is found, the UI blocks the "Start" action and clearly tells the user which install is already running and needs to be stopped first — no raw port-in-use errors surfaced from Docker.
- This check belongs in the shared `docker_ctl.py` / `runner.py` layer (Phase 1) so every per-game controller inherits it for free, rather than each `controller_<acronym>/` reimplementing the check.

---

## 13. Networking Auto-Setup (LAN & Internet Play)

Goal 1 (§1) promises "no user-facing shell." That extends to getting other players connected —
the most error-prone, shell-heavy part of the current experience, covered today by the manual
guide `archive/guides/wow-wotlk/WoW-Wotlk-NETWORKING.md`. The Controller automatically sets up
both modes, surfacing only clear prompts/status rather than terminal commands.

**Two modes, two levels of automation:**

| Mode | Audience | What the app automates | What it cannot automate |
|---|---|---|---|
| **LAN** (same Wi-Fi) | Friends/household on the local network | Detect local IP; set `realmlist` `address`/`localAddress` (ports 3724/8085) in the auth DB; open the host firewall (UFW / firewalld / `netsh` + Windows "Private" network check); on WSL2, add `netsh interface portproxy` if ports are bound to `127.0.0.1`; write `realmlist.wtf` for each client | Nothing — LAN is fully automatable |
| **Internet play** (anyone, anywhere) | Remote friends | Everything in LAN mode, plus: detect the public IP; set `realmlist` `address` to it | Router admin — DHCP reservation, port forwarding (TCP 3724/8085). The app **detects and prompts** for these steps (with router-specific pointers) rather than silently failing; a router without UPnP cannot be configured by the app |

**Cross-platform realities the app must handle** (all documented in the existing guide):
- **Windows/WSL2:** the `172.x.x.x` WSL2 address is *not* the LAN address — always use the
  Windows IPv4 from `ipconfig`. The app must read the Windows host address, not the WSL2 guest.
- **Ports must be bound to `0.0.0.0`, not `127.0.0.1`**, or LAN players can't connect. The app
  verifies the compose port bindings and warns/fixes before starting.
- **CGNAT** (mobile/LTE ISPs) blocks port forwarding entirely — the app detects a failed
  forwarding attempt and explains it clearly rather than reporting a silent timeout.
- **Dynamic public IP** — the app re-checks the public IP on change and offers a free dynamic-DNS
  option (DuckDNS) for persistent hosting, mirroring the guide's "Dynamic IP Warning."

**Design constraints:**
- This is **data + orchestration, not UI or per-game hardcoding.** The port table (auth 3724,
  world 8085, optional db 3306 — see the guide's "Port Reference") and the per-OS firewall
  commands belong in `catalog.json`/manifests and a `platform.py` firewall helper, following
  style-guide §3 (separation of concerns), §4 (DRY — one shared implementation, not one per game).
- **UI copy may spell out for the user what the app is doing** (style-guide §6's "one exception"),
  but logs/identifiers stay acronym-only.
- **Sequenced as its own step** in `roadmap.md` Phase 3/4 (installer + controller wiring), since
  it depends on both the shared port-conflict check (§12) and the UI's controller surface.
