# Where things stand, 2026-09-05 09:45 — written before a compact

`yulon-phase7` was at **0cc637c7** when this note was first written (see `git log` for the tip), pushed, CI green (py3.11, py3.13, integration) on PR **#143 → Yulon**.
The working tree is **clean**: every piece of in-flight work is on a `lane/*` branch, so nothing lives
only in a conversation.

## Phase 7: 7 of 12 ticked

Open: 7.1, 7.2, 7.7, 7.8 (hardware), 7.10.

* **7.1** — the realm clause is MET (measured: row `172.30.55.119`, and `ready`'s own line at
  `gate72-press3.log:3377`), and **clause 14 is MET as of 07:31:41 today**: a real 3.3.5a client
  authenticated against the 7.2 install — `COP_AUTHENTICATE AUTH_OK`, `COP_GET_CHARACTERS code=44
  result=TRUE`; server side `102 GATELOGIN last_login 2026-09-05 05:31:40 online 1 failed_logins 0`.
  That account was made through `ControllerServices`, so it is clause 13 evidence too. Route: an
  `ssh -L` tunnel with the realm temporarily at `127.0.0.1` — **Tailscale did not survive the
  clean-ssh restore** — both since put back. Clause 15 (the LAN step) waits on §39.
* **7.2** — TICKED at `bdee23f5` (13:30 CEST): `lane/clause72` reworded the stale clause on what it
  meant, measured the deletion on both sides of `2fddaa0e`, and went through five review rounds
  before its record stopped carrying numbers written from memory. The previous lane refused to reword a criterion so it passes,
  which was right.
* **7.7** — Tortoise PASSED on `yulon-win11-gate` at 00:43:19 box-local (exit 0, banner `Loading time:
  59 minutes 18 seconds`, `RestartCount=0`). Widened to `["linux", "windows"]` and the ready budget
  moved 3600 → 10800 s at `eb5f3b3f` (the stage measured 3702 s wall; evidence in
  `pyplan/gates/7.7-win11-tortoise/`). TICKED the same afternoon: WotLK's fresh run exit 0 (2 h 34 min, `7.7-win11-wotlk/`)
  and TBC's second press exit 0 under the quiet budget (`7.7-win11-tbc-second-press/`), so all
  four games carry an exit-0 transcript on native Windows.

## The eight lane branches, and what each owes

| branch | tip | state |
|---|---|---|
| `lane/ticks` | 2e8ae66c | MERGED at 0cc637c7 |
| `lane/readybudget` | bbe6cdf4 | round 3 running — 2 blockers: a WSL cross-daemon read, and the `restarting` alive-status no test owns |
| `lane/cancelcopy` | 2a4f0cab | round 3 running — the copy ignores the state file the app itself wrote |
| `lane/headlesslog` | a20dae99 | round 3 running — the no-write rule is in-process only; the suite spawns children |
| `lane/bug39-r6` | 380ef4ed | MERGED at `0bdbc4e3` after round 10 — owner: "stop at 10" (2026-09-05). Guard ALLOWs on the production path; Docker's zone judged machine-made on the real Fedora listings; the LAN button itself is still never pressed end to end on a real remote box (§39 stays OPEN on that) |
| `lane/doodad` | 851d0ca9 | MERGED at `5a57164d` after round 10 (same decision). The wedge is unreachable; the refused press launches no container; the issue draft's patch now applies (`doodad-2026-09-05/apply-check.txt`, doc-v2 exit 0 on both pinned revisions) |
| `lane/clause72` | ed3102b6 | MERGED into `yulon-phase7` at `bdee23f5`; worktree and branch deleted |
| `lane/dockerfile-value` | c1baabea | MERGED at `bdee23f5` — §29's value half closed; `render()` refuses a public value that carries the secret |

## Running in the background, and it survives a compact

* Workflow `wzizt9czj` (round 5 on readybudget / cancelcopy / headlesslog; round 4's verdicts and
  the meta-reviews are in the session scratchpad as `r4-*.json`). A fresh WotLK install is running
  on `yulon-win11-gate` into `D:\gate\wotlk-server77` from source `a0cc9dc0`, transcript
  `C:\gate\evidence\wotlk77.log` (started 01:46 box-local after a preflight refusal on Docker's
  disk; the VHDX was compacted 32.6 → 12.0 GB and the Tortoise stack stopped for the run).
* The Tortoise watcher is done (see 7.7 above). Every VM is at its baseline as of 10:15 CEST
  (`vmsize.ps1 -Show`: only `yulon-fedora` had drifted, down to 4/4, restored to 10/11 while Off).
  `C:\Users\PK\vmsize.ps1` on the host does the resizing and restoring, with write-once baselines;
  its headroom check now applies to Running VMs only, since an Off VM's configured memory costs nothing.

## Owner decisions still open

1. **7.8 macOS** — rent a Mac, or mark it deferred and ship at 11 of 12. `ci/macos-intel-dmg` is
   unmerged and has no PR; it was deliberately kept in the branch cleanup.
2. **Whether to post the upstream CMaNGOS issue.** Its patch now applies on both pinned revisions
   (`pyplan/gates/doodad-2026-09-05/apply-check.txt`: doc-v2 exit 0, byte-identical to the shipped
   patch). Nothing has been posted; that is the owner's call.

## Bug checklist

Closed: §21, §27, §29 (both halves, `bdee23f5`), §30, §33, §40, §42 (headless log, `745307ad`, gate met on the Windows TBC second press). Filed: §43 (`keep_awake()` refuses the headless harness's own thread). Open: §39 (round 5 committed, two
measured lockout routes left — **the LAN button is not done**), §41 (loopback realm), §42 (a headless
install writes no log).

## Handoff, 21:15 CEST — for the workflow that does "all the open ones"

Tree: `yulon-phase7` at `d911d3d5`, pushed, CI green, no lane branches or worktrees. 9 of 12 boxes.
Owner, 2026-09-05 evening: "stop at 10" (no lane gets more than ten review rounds; after ten the
merger closes line-level findings by hand and records the rest), then "we do all the open ones in
workflow".

**The open items, in the order that unblocks the most:**
1. **7.10 re-run** — the widget gate on `yulon-ubuntu` (the live 7.2 install; `pyplan/gates/7.10-gaps/`
   and `7.10-ubuntu-2026-09-04/` hold the drivers) on the merged engine. The two findings it filed on
   09-04 are what `lane/cancelcopy` fixed; the re-run is what ticks 7.10. Read-only elsewhere; this
   box IS the gate box.
2. **§41 loopback realm on purpose** — a third `networking.Mode`, intent persisted where a resume can
   read it, `ready` reading it before it overwrites; gate as written in the entry. `networking.py` is
   free now (§39's lane merged).
3. **§39 the LAN button end to end** — the guard is merged; what 7.1 clause 15 needs is the app's own
   LAN step pressed on a real remote Linux box with a console fallback (a throwaway VM reached through
   `ssh vmhost` + Hyper-V console, never a box the lane is logged into by ssh alone). Two measured
   lockouts in the record; the round-6 run on yulon-fedora applied and restored with a
   `systemd-run` failsafe — copy that shape.
4. **§43** — `keep_awake()` refuses the headless harness's main thread; small, Windows-measurable on
   `yulon-win11-gate` (Off; start it, host has the headroom).
5. **7.8 macOS** and **whether to post the CMaNGOS issue** — owner decisions, not lane work. The issue
   draft's patch applies (`pyplan/gates/doodad-2026-09-05/apply-check.txt`).

**Boxes for the lanes** (owner: "why are you not using the VMs?"): m910q (Py 3.11) and
`yulon-fedora` (Py 3.13, SELinux Enforcing; clone + venv at `~/dads-mmo-lab`, Off now — start with
`ssh vmhost 'Start-VM -Name yulon-fedora'`, check host free memory ≥ 12 GB after) are both
`run-tests-vm.sh` targets (`YULON_TEST_BOX=…`). `yulon-arch` (10/11) has no clone yet. One box per
lane; agents must never stop a VM. `yulon-ubuntu` is the 7.10 gate box, not a test box.

**Round discipline that finally held:** every number/SHA/line in a record from a command in the same
sitting, pinned to SHAs; a docstring naming a mutation as proof shows the red and which assertion;
every present-tense claim in the diff read against a command before commit; the reviewer re-derives
on the real shape; fable reviews the review. Rounds 6-10 of §39 were all "behaviour right, one
sentence false in one shape" — cap at 10 and close by hand.
