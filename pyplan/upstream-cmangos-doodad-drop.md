# Upstream CMaNGOS defect: WMO doodad placements are dropped on case-sensitive filesystems

Written 2026-09-04 by lane D of the Phase 7 gate work. The first nine sections are addressed to a
CMaNGOS maintainer and assume no knowledge of this project. §10 is ours: whether Yu'lon should work
around the defect while it is open, and it is a recommendation, not a decision.

Evidence: `pyplan/gates/7.7-win11-gate/buildings-shortfall-measurements.txt` and the file lists
beside it. Recorded in `pyplan/checklist.md` under 7.7.

---

## 1. In one paragraph

`vmap_extractor` writes each WMO's interior doodad models to `Buildings/` under the **raw** name
found in the WMO's `MODN` chunk (`INNBED.M2`), and then looks the same model up under the
**case-normalised** name (`Innbed.m2`) when it comes to write that doodad's placement into
`Buildings/dir_bin`. On NTFS or a case-insensitive APFS the lookup resolves anyway and the
placement is written. On ext4 it misses, and `Doodad::ExtractSet()` does `if (!input) continue;` —
the placement is discarded, silently, and the run finishes with `Work complete. No errors.`

Same client, same source commit, two filesystems, two different servers, no message either way.
Measured on WoW 1.12.1 with `cmangos/mangos-classic` at `8ec338a1`: the Linux extraction wrote
**429,016** placements where the Windows one wrote **503,722**. **74,706 placements, 14.8%,
dropped without a word.**

---

## 2. What a player sees — stated conservatively

Nothing disappears and nothing looks wrong. The client draws the world from its own local data,
which is complete, and client-side collision is unaffected: a player still cannot walk through the
bed. The loss is entirely server-side, in the collision/line-of-sight geometry the core loads from
`vmaps`, and it is confined to **M2 models placed inside WMOs** — building and dungeon interiors.
Terrain is untouched, the building shells are untouched (the same 814 `.wmo` files were present on
both sides), and outdoor doodads placed from ADT `MDDF` records are untouched, because
that code path is correct (§4).

What is actually affected, in decreasing order of confidence:

* **Line of sight.** `vmaps` are the store the core answers `IsInLineOfSight()` from. A prop that
  should block a spell or an aggro check does not block it, so a caster can be hit through a
  bookshelf, and mobs notice players they should not be able to see. Concentrated in dungeon
  interiors — of the 296 models that lost every one of their placements, the list reads like the
  furniture manifest of a dungeon: `Scholme_Bookshelf`, `Scholme_Bookshelflarge`, `Uldamantable01`,
  `Wc_Cairn` and the Wailing Caverns druid props, `Blackrockbloodmachine01`–`04`, `Elfbed01`–`03`,
  `Wardrobedwarvenaverage02`, braziers and candelabras by the dozen. One of them is
  `Auctioneercollision.m2` — a model that exists for nothing but collision, so its loss is the
  whole of its purpose.
* **NPC and bot pathing.** `contrib/mmap/src/TerrainBuilder.cpp:561-573` builds the navmesh by
  loading `vmaps` for each tile, so a doodad missing from `vmaps` is missing from `mmaps` too.
  Creatures and bots then path as though the props were not there, and route through a bookshelf
  the client draws them clipping into.
* **Server-side height.** `GetHeight()` also consults `vmaps`. We did not measure a specific
  in-game consequence and are not claiming one.

Honest scale: this is a degradation, not a breakage. A server built from a Linux extraction runs,
is playable, and most players would never name what is wrong — but 14.8% of the world's placed
collision geometry is absent from it, permanently, and nobody was told.

## 3. Affected trees

Read out of the checkouts, not assumed:

| repo | commit read | `wmo.cpp` `MODN` handler | `ExtractSingleModel()` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cmangos/mangos-classic` | `8ec338a1704e7dcb1c0213eb7ed58f9231ade40f` | line 85, defective | `gameobject_extract.cpp:9`, defective |
| `cmangos/mangos-tbc` | `f82e7d679c283b66bc2adc1b751aa1275e655673` | line 85, byte-identical | byte-identical |

`mangos-wotlk` was not read and is presumed to carry the same file. AzerothCore's `vmap4extractor`
descends from the same code and was **not** checked; anyone relying on that lineage should read its
equivalent of these two functions before assuming it is clean.

---

## 4. The two functions, and the one that gets it right

Three call sites hand a model path to `ExtractSingleModel()`. Its own header states the
precondition:

```c
// vmapexport.h:53
/* @param origPath = original path of the model, cleaned with fixnamen and fixname2
 * @param fixedName = will store the translated name (if changed)
 * @param failedPaths = Set to collect errors
 */
bool ExtractSingleModel(std::string& origPath, std::string& fixedName, StringSet& failedPaths);
```

**`adtfile.cpp` obeys it**, and its own comment says why the order matters:

```c
// adtfile.cpp:148-156, MMDX handler
while (p < buf + size)
{
    fixnamen(p, strlen(p));
    char* s = GetPlainName(p);
    fixname2(s, strlen(s));
    string path(p);                         // Store copy after name fixed
                                            //          ^^^^^
    std::string fixedName;
    ExtractSingleModel(path, fixedName, failedPaths);
```

**`wmo.cpp` does not.** The copy is taken one line too early — before the two functions mutate the
buffer — so the path handed on is the raw one:

```c
// wmo.cpp:85-105, MODN handler
else if (!strcmp(fourcc, "MODN"))
{
    char* ptr = f.getPointer();
    char* end = ptr + size;
    DoodadData.Paths = std::make_unique<char[]>(size);
    memcpy(DoodadData.Paths.get(), ptr, size);   // raw names, kept for ExtractSet()
    while (ptr < end)
    {
        std::string path = ptr;                  // <-- COPY TAKEN BEFORE THE FIX

        char* s = GetPlainName(ptr);
        fixnamen(s, strlen(s));                  // fixes the buffer; `path` already holds the raw name
        fixname2(s, strlen(s));

        uint32 doodadNameIndex = ptr - f.getPointer();
        ptr += path.length() + 1;

        std::string fixedName;
        if (ExtractSingleModel(path, fixedName, failedPaths))   // <-- RAW path passed
            ValidDoodadNames.insert(doodadNameIndex);
    }
}
```

`ExtractSingleModel()` then names the output file from whatever it was given, applying neither
function itself:

```c
// gameobject_extract.cpp:9-33
bool ExtractSingleModel(std::string& origPath, std::string& fixedName, StringSet& failedPaths)
{
    ...
    // ".MDX" -> ".M2" by erase(len-2, 2) + append("2")   =>  INNBED.MDX -> INNBED.M2
    fixedName = GetPlainName(origPath.c_str());          // line 26 — raw plain name

    std::string output(szWorkDirWmo);
    output += "/";
    output += fixedName;                                 // Buildings/INNBED.M2

    if (FileExists(output.c_str()))
        return true;
```

And the reader, running over the same `MODN` bytes that `memcpy()` preserved in their raw form,
re-derives the **fixed** spelling and opens that:

```c
// model.cpp:223-260, Doodad::ExtractSet()
    char ModelInstName[1024];
    sprintf(ModelInstName, "%s", GetPlainName(&doodadData.Paths[doodad.NameIndex]));  // INNBED.MDX
    uint32 nlen = strlen(ModelInstName);
    fixnamen(ModelInstName, nlen);          // Innbed.mdx
    fixname2(ModelInstName, nlen);
    ...                                      // ".mdx"/".mdl" -> ".m2"   =>  Innbed.m2

    char tempname[...];
    sprintf(tempname, "%s/%s", szWorkDirWmo, ModelInstName);
    FILE* input = fopen(tempname, "r+b");    // Buildings/Innbed.m2
    if (!input)
        continue;                            // <-- the placement is dropped, silently
```

**The writer writes `INNBED.M2` and the reader asks for `Innbed.m2`.** That is the whole defect.

Witnessed on the Linux box, in a `Buildings/` directory the extractor had just filled:

```
$ ls Buildings/Innbed.m2
ls: cannot access 'Buildings/Innbed.m2': No such file or directory
$ ls -l Buildings/INNBED.M2
-rw-r--r-- 1 pk pk 840 ... Buildings/INNBED.M2
```

*Adjacent, not part of this report and not investigated:* at `model.cpp:251-252` the `.mdx` → `.m2`
shortening writes a terminating `'\0'` into `ModelInstName` without decrementing `nlen`, and `nlen`
is what the record at the end of the function declares and writes. We did not test what the loader
makes of the extra byte, and we are not claiming it is a bug.

---

## 5. Why it is silent

Two separate silences, and either one alone would have made this visible:

* `Doodad::ExtractSet()`'s `continue` prints nothing and counts nothing. 74,706 dropped placements
  produced zero output lines.
* The extractor's existing "some models could not be extracted" warning does not fire, because from
  its point of view nothing failed to extract. The model file was written. It was written under a
  name nobody later asked for.

The Linux run's own summary was `Extract for VMAPs05. Work complete. No errors.`

---

## 6. Minimal reproduction — one Linux box, one extraction, no third-party tooling

This needs neither a second machine nor a comparison run. A model file with **zero** placements in
`dir_bin` is already proof, because the only reason a WMO doodad model is extracted at all is that
some WMO's `MODN` named it and its doodad set placed it.

1. Build `contrib/vmap_extractor` from `cmangos/mangos-classic` (or `mangos-tbc`) as usual.
2. Run it against any 1.12.1 client, on a **case-sensitive** filesystem (ext4 is enough).
3. Then:

```sh
cd <client>/Buildings

# The model was extracted, under the raw all-caps name — the writer's spelling:
ls INNBED.M2                                          # present, 840 bytes
ls Innbed.m2                                          # No such file  <- the reader's spelling

# And it is placed nowhere, under either spelling:
strings -a dir_bin | grep -o -i 'innbed\.m2' | wc -l  # 0

# The same sweep over every all-caps model, in one pass, if one witness is not enough:
strings -a dir_bin | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z' | grep -o '[a-z0-9_.-]*\.m2' | sort -u > /tmp/placed
ls *.M2 | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z' | sort -u > /tmp/extracted
comm -23 /tmp/extracted /tmp/placed | wc -l           # extracted, placed nowhere
```

A model that was extracted and placed nowhere is the dropped placement. Repeat on a
case-insensitive filesystem and `dir_bin` grows; §7 is how we did that.

---

## 7. How it was found

By accident, and then by holding every variable still.

A Windows gate and a Linux gate installed the same server, and the `Buildings/` file counts
disagreed: **5,076 on Linux, 3,913 on Windows**. The first reading was "Windows is short", and it
was backwards. Diffing the two sorted listings instead of comparing their totals:

* 1,163 names in the Linux listing and not the Windows one; **0** the other way.
* All 1,163 are `.m2`. Every one has a case-insensitive twin present on Windows — **1,163 of
  1,163**. Unique case-insensitive names in the Linux listing: **3,913**, the Windows file count to
  the file.
* `md5` and size of all 1,163 pairs, computed on the Linux box where both spellings exist: **SAME
  1,163 / DIFF 0.** NTFS had folded byte-identical duplicates onto their twin, and the Windows run
  had lost no unique bytes at all.

So the file count was a red herring, and the real comparison was the placement index:

| | Linux (ext4) | Windows (NTFS) | difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Buildings/dir_bin` | 31,072,203 B | 36,635,438 B | +5,563,235 B (15.2%) |
| distinct model names in it | 2,981 | 3,348 | +367 (11.0%) |
| placements | **429,016** | **503,722** | **+74,706 (14.8%)** |
| `Buildings/temp_gameobject_models` | 24,991 B | 24,991 B | — |

Not a truncated tail: 284 of the 367 Windows-only names first appear *below* Linux's own
end-of-file offset.

The distribution of those 367 is what makes the diagnosis airtight, because no other cause produces
it:

* **296** exist on the Linux box **only** in all-caps (`INNBED.M2`, no `Innbed.m2`). No ADT ever
  referenced them, so no correctly-named copy was ever written, so the lookup could never hit.
* **71** exist in both spellings — an ADT elsewhere in the run happened to write the fixed-name
  copy, and whether the lookup hit depended on whether that happened first. Order-dependent.
* **0** exist in neither spelling. The model was always on disk. Only the name was wrong.

Everything else was held: all 20 files under `Data/` matched byte for byte across the two boxes,
`wmo.MPQ` — the archive this tool reads — hashed identically
(`9933d9ca...fc56edb7`), and the source commit `8ec338a1` was read out of each box's own clone
rather than taken from a pin.

---

## 8. The fix

Make the writer use the spelling the reader asks for. The smallest change that does that, and the
one we would suggest, is in `ExtractSingleModel()` — it repairs all three call sites at once and
leaves `origPath` alone, so the path used for the MPQ read is unchanged:

```diff
--- a/contrib/vmap_extractor/vmapextract/gameobject_extract.cpp
+++ b/contrib/vmap_extractor/vmapextract/gameobject_extract.cpp
@@ -23,6 +23,10 @@ bool ExtractSingleModel(std::string& origPath, std::string& fixedName, StringSet
     // nothing do
 
     fixedName = GetPlainName(origPath.c_str());
+    // The output filename must be spelled the way Doodad::ExtractSet() will later
+    // ask for it (model.cpp), or the placement is dropped on a case-sensitive
+    // filesystem. wmo.cpp's MODN handler passes a path this was not applied to.

+    fixname2(&fixedName[0], fixedName.length());
 
     std::string output(szWorkDirWmo);
     output += "/";
```

No new include is needed: `ExtractGameobjectModels()` in the same translation unit already calls
both functions at lines 67 and 69.

**The one thing this depends on** is that both functions are idempotent, so the ADT and
GameObjectDisplayInfo callers — which already pass a cleaned path — see no change. Reading them
says they are: `fixnamen()` title-cases each alphabetic run and lower-cases the extension, and a
name already in that form is a fixed point; `fixname2()` replaces `' '` with `'_'`, and there are
none left to replace. That is a claim from reading, not from running, and it is the assertion a
maintainer should test first.

**The alternative fix**, which is arguably the more natural one, is to move `std::string path =
ptr;` in `wmo.cpp` below the `fixnamen`/`fixname2` pair, exactly as `adtfile.cpp:153` already does.
One line moved. We prefer the first because this one *also* changes the path handed to `Model
mdl(origPath)` for the archive read, and `fixname2()` turns spaces into underscores. There is at
least one model in the 1.12.1 archives whose ADT-path lookup already fails in a way consistent with
that — `Could not find file of model World\Generic\Quilboar\Passive Doodads\Leantos\
Razorfen_Leanto03.m2`, printed once on both boxes, with the space kept in the directory and an
underscore in the plain name, which is the exact shape `fixname2()` on a plain name produces. We
did not prove that connection, but it is a reason not to widen the same code path to WMO doodads.

**Separately, and worth taking regardless of which fix lands:** `Doodad::ExtractSet()`'s `continue`
should count what it drops and print the total. Had it done so, this would have been a one-line
report from the first Linux run instead of a two-day cross-platform diff.

### What the fix costs someone who re-runs an extraction

* **On a case-insensitive filesystem it changes nothing.** NTFS and case-insensitive APFS already
  resolved the mismatch, so Windows and most macOS users re-extract for no benefit. The
  beneficiaries are case-sensitive filesystems — which is to say Linux, and every Docker image
  built on one.
* **The on-disk names change.** WMO-only doodad models move from `INNBED.M2` to `Innbed.m2`.
  `ExtractSingleModel()`'s `FileExists()` early-return keys on the new name, so a re-run into an
  existing `Buildings/` re-extracts them and leaves the old all-caps files behind as dead weight —
  in our vanilla measurement that duplicate set was 1,163 files.
* **`dir_bin` and the model files must come from the same run.** A `dir_bin` written before the fix
  names `INNBED.M2`; a fixed extractor writes `Innbed.m2`. Mixing them is worse than either. The
  practical instruction is: delete `Buildings/`, re-run `vmap_extractor`, then `vmap_assembler`,
  then `mmaps_generator` — the last because the navmesh is built from `vmaps`
  (`contrib/mmap/src/TerrainBuilder.cpp:561`). In practice the extractor's own "Your output
  directory seems to be polluted" refusal makes extracting on top unavailable anyway.
* **Measured price of that:** `vmap_extractor` alone took **83 minutes** on our Windows gate box
  (19:32:18 → 20:55:57, `pyplan/gates/7.7-win11-gate/vanilla77.log`) for the 1.12.1 client.
  Assemble and mmaps are on top of that. We have no equivalent figure for the Linux box.
* **And the payoff is invisible in a file listing.** After the fix a Linux `Buildings/` gets
  *smaller* (no duplicate spellings) while `dir_bin` gets *larger*. Anyone checking the fix by
  counting files will read it as a regression. Count placements in `dir_bin`.

---

## 9. Reporting checklist

Everything a maintainer needs is above. If more is wanted, the raw artefacts are:
`buildings-shortfall-measurements.txt` (every number with the command that produced it),
`linux-buildings.txt` / `windows-buildings.txt` (the two sorted listings),
`only-linux.txt` / `only-windows.txt` (the `comm` output, the second one empty),
`collision-pairs.txt` (the 1,163 twin mappings), `pair-compare.txt` (md5+size of every pair),
`win-dirbin-names.txt` / `linux-dirbin-names.txt`, `dirbin-win-only-names.txt` (the 367) and
`dirbin-win-only-capsonly.txt` (the 296 — 295 lines, the file has no trailing newline). All under
`pyplan/gates/7.7-win11-gate/`.

---

## 10. Ours to decide: should Yu'lon work around it?

**Recommendation: yes — carry the patch — but file the report first, and pin the revs before the
patch, because we do not currently pin them at all.**

### The premise needs a correction first

The brief for this page said "we already clone at a pinned rev". We do not, for the trees that
matter. `Source.rev` exists in `yulon/manifest.py:71` (40 hex characters, default `None`) and
`catalog.json` sets it on exactly one entry — `wow-tortoise`, two sources. `wow-vanilla`,
`wow-tbc` and `wow-wotlk` all clone the branch tip with `rev: null`. That `8ec338a1` was the commit
on both gate boxes is because both clones happened within a day of each other, not because anything
held it.

This changes the shape of the workaround. A patch applied to a moving tip breaks the first time
upstream touches those lines — **including when they fix it**, which is the good outcome and would
then fail every install.

### The three options, weighed

**A. Do nothing and wait for upstream.** Costs nothing to implement and leaves every Linux install
we make short 14.8% of its placed collision geometry, silently, for an unbounded time. It also
leaves our two platforms producing measurably different servers from the same inputs, so any
cross-platform check of extraction output stays untrustworthy unless it folds case. Both affected
repos are actively developed — the tip we read was dated 2026-08-30 — which is a reason to expect a
response, not a date to plan against.

**B. Patch the source after clone.** The seam exists and is clean. `families/cmangos.py:217` binds
`Stage("clone-sources", self._clone_sources)`; `_clone_sources` at `:233` delegates to
`NativeInstall.stage_clone_sources()` (`yulon/catalog/native.py:1476`), which walks the entry's
`emulator.sources` and calls `self._clone(git.CloneSpec(...))` at `:1523`. The patch belongs in a
**new stage after it**, not inside that loop — that loop's single job is "clone what the manifest
names", and the family already owns its own stage list. So: a `patch-sources` stage in the CMaNGOS
family, a patch artifact committed in this repo, a state-file record so a resume does not apply it
twice, and a tolerant apply — detect the fix already present and skip; refuse loudly, naming the
file and line, if the context has moved — because that is what makes the stage survive the day
upstream lands their own fix.

**C. Detect the shortfall after extraction and warn.** Cheap and mechanical: compare the distinct
model names in `Buildings/dir_bin` against the model files in `Buildings/`. On our Linux run that
reads 2,981 against 3,913 unique models — 932 extracted models with zero placements, a number that
cannot be innocent — and the manifest already has the shape for a check that refuses or warns
(`yulon/manifest.py`, the mmaps shortfall field). But a warning has no remedy attached: it tells a
user their dungeon interiors are short and offers them nothing to do about it, and it improves no
player's server by one placement.

### Why B

A and C both leave the defect in the product. Linux is our primary platform, the loss is silent and
permanent per install, and the fix is three lines in a file that changes rarely. C is worth building
**as the gate that proves B worked** — not as a shipped warning — because it is the only check that
would have caught this in the first place and the only one that will catch a patch that silently
stops applying.

### What B costs, plainly

1. **Pin `rev` on the two CMaNGOS entries first.** That is a change with its own consequences:
   installs stop picking up upstream fixes until someone bumps the pin, so the pin needs an owner
   and a cadence. It is worth doing on its own merits — an unpinned tip means no two installs are
   the same build — but it is a decision, not a detail.
2. **A real feature, not a one-liner.** New stage, patch artifact, resume-safety, and tests for
   three cases: applies, already applied, does not apply. Comparable in size to any other single
   stage in that family.
3. **No retro-fit.** Existing Linux installs stay deficient. The benefit arrives only on a fresh
   extract — 83 minutes for `vmap_extractor` on the gate box, plus assemble and mmaps.
4. **A standing obligation.** While the patch is carried, any extractor oddity is ours to disprove
   before it is upstream's to explain; and when upstream merges the fix, someone has to notice and
   delete ours.
5. **First action is free.** File the report. If upstream takes it in days, B never ships and we
   have spent nothing but this page. Hold B ready rather than starting it, and pin the revs now.

The owner decides. This lane wrote the page and implemented nothing.

---

## 11. What was done (2026-09-05, lane `doodad`, branch `lane/doodad`)

The owner decided for B, with the pins first and option C as the gate. Recorded here in the
order it happened, with what was measured and where.

**Pins.** Every source of every shipped entry now carries a `rev`, read out of the gate boxes'
own checkouts rather than a branch tip: Vanilla's three from `/home/pk/vanilla-75` on `m910q`
(gate 7.5; core `8ec338a1`, the commit both boxes in §7 were on), TBC's three from
`/home/pk/tbc-7.4c` on `m910q` (gate 7.4c; core `f82e7d67` — the Linux commit, not the Windows
run's `0d2ebc3e`, because 7.4c is the gate with the whole evidence chain on the primary platform
and `gates/7.7-win11-tbc/source-identity.txt` already established that the one commit between
them touches `src/game` only), WotLK's two from `/home/pk/wowserver` on `yulon-ubuntu` (gate
7.1's clean 2026-09-04 run; `gate71-press2.log` prints `AzerothCore revision : 413bea61a85e+`
and names no commit for the module, so both were read off the box). `test_catalog.py` holds the
values (`GATE_PINS`) and, separately, the rule that no shipped source is unpinned.

**The patch.** `catalog/installers/shared/cmangos/patches/vmap-extractor-doodad-name-case.patch`:
§8's `ExtractSingleModel()` fix plus the counter §8 asked for "regardless" — `Doodad::ExtractSet()`
names each missing model once and the run's summary prints the total. Four files, five hunks,
generated by `git diff` from an edited copy of the pinned classic tree. §3 said `model.cpp` was
not compared; it differs between classic and TBC (a commented-out block above `ExtractSet`), which
is why the counter's definition lives in `vmapexport.cpp` beside the other globals and no hunk
anchors on that function's head. `git apply --check` passes on `mangos-classic` `8ec338a1` and
`mangos-tbc` `f82e7d67`, and refuses on `mangos-wotlk` `4cea3890` — whose `ExtractSingleModel()`
already normalises the name and which no shipped entry clones (`wow-wotlk` is AzerothCore).
Tortoise carries no patch: its extractor is the older lineage whose `wmo.cpp` runs `fixnamen()`
over the whole MODN block in place before writer or reader reads a name (`7c0fb278`,
`tools/vmap_extractor/vmapextract/wmo.cpp:98`), so the two agree there. That sentence was a
reading until 2026-09-05, and reading is how the same conclusion was reached about
`mangos-classic` before an extraction disproved half of it — so it was run. On `m910q` that
extractor was built from `7c0fb278` and run against the Turtle client (86 s, exit 0, 5,367 files
in `Buildings/`), and `extract.doodad_placements()` over the output answers
`DoodadCheck(extracted=4041, placed=2675, unplaced=1366, misspelt=0)`: no all-caps `.M2`, no name
with a space, not one file spelled a way the placement index would not ask for
(`pyplan/gates/doodad-2026-09-05/tortoise-doodadcheck.txt`).

**Verified by running, on `m910q`, 2026-09-05, 1.12.1 client, extractor built from `8ec338a1` in
an `ubuntu:22.04` container with the Vanilla Dockerfile's apt list.** Full extraction, not a
subset — it takes 32–35 s on that box, against the 83 minutes §8 quotes for the Windows gate over
9p, so nothing was left unshown:

| build | `Buildings/` files | `dir_bin` bytes | name occurrences (§7's count) | distinct | misspelt files | unplaced models |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| unpatched | 5,076 | 31,072,203 | 429,016 | 2,981 | 1,464 | 802 |
| patched | 3,913 | 36,639,894 | **503,782** | 3,349 | **0** | 434 |
| counter only (name fix reverted) | 5,076 | 31,072,203 | 429,016 | 2,981 | 1,464 | 802 |

The unpatched numbers are §7's Linux numbers to the byte, which holds the box and the build
constant against the gate. The counter-only build printed `WARNING: 74722 WMO doodad placements
were dropped because their model file was not found under ./Buildings` over 738 distinct
`Doodad model … is not in ./Buildings` lines; the patched build printed none and its summary
carried no warning. Against §7's Windows run: 503,782 placements to 503,722 and 3,349 distinct
names to 3,348 — the one extra is `razorfen_leanto03.m2`, 60 occurrences, the model §8 already
flagged for the space in its path; not investigated and not claimed. "Misspelt" is a model file
whose name is not a fixed point of `fixnamen`+`fixname2` (ported to `extract.reader_spelling()`);
"unplaced" is the case-folded set difference §10's option C described, and the 434 that remain
after the fix are what a correct extraction looks like — the `strings`-and-`comm` recipe in §6
counts them too, so **§10's "932 … a number that cannot be innocent" overstated it**: 802 on this
box, of which 434 are innocent.

**The stage.** `patch-sources`, second in the CMaNGOS family's tuple, bound to
`families/patch.py` — a unified-diff applier of our own rather than `git apply`, so "already
applied" is an answer and not a prompt, the outcome is the same on every platform, and a refusal
names the file and the line and writes nothing (every hunk of every file is resolved before the
first byte is written). Tolerant in two ways only: a hunk found at an offset from its stated
line applies; a hunk whose post-image is already present is skipped — and for a hunk that
removes nothing, the post-image is the question asked FIRST, at its hinted line (defect 2
below, and §12). The record in the state
file is NOT what skips it — a deleted checkout is re-cloned on disk evidence while the record
survives — so the body reads the files on every press. The catalog names the patch per entry
(`CmangosData.patches`, `SourcePatch{file, source, reason}`), and `CatalogEntry` refuses a
`source` that is not one of the entry's own dests.

**Option C**, as the gate. After the extraction tools, `_extract` reads `Buildings/` against
`dir_bin` and yields one line: a warning when any model file is misspelt (the defect's
fingerprint; 1,464 → 0 above), plain counts otherwise. Keyed on misspelt and not on unplaced,
for the reason in the table: 434 unplaced is a clean run, and a warning that fires on every
install teaches users to ignore warnings. A warning and not a refusal, because the install
is not wrong by shape — it boots and plays — and a refusal would take a working server away
over a defect only a rebuild mends; what the line is for is the day the patch silently stops
applying.

**Three defects the lane's own review found before it merged, and what they cost to fix**
(`pyplan/gates/doodad-2026-09-05/`):

1. *The report shipped a patch that does not apply.* The fenced ```` ```diff ```` in the issue
   text was an earlier revision of the patch file beside it — `vmapexport.cpp` anchored at
   `@@ -58,6 +58,7 @@ std::set<std::string> gameobjectFiles;`, against a declaration block that
   has moved — while the paragraph above it said "byte-for-byte". `git apply --check` on the
   fenced version exits 1 on `mangos-classic` `8ec338a1` AND on `mangos-tbc` `f82e7d67`, the two
   commits the issue itself names, while the shipped file exits 0 on both (`apply-check.txt`).
   A maintainer's first act on an issue is to apply the patch. The fence is now the shipped
   bytes and `test_the_issue_docs_fenced_diff_is_the_shipped_patch_byte_for_byte` holds them
   equal — through `read_text()`, which was the half of this that survived; see §12.

2. *An insertion-only hunk re-applied on every press.* `patch.apply()` asked "is the pre-image
   here?" first, and a hunk with no `-` lines has a pre-image of pure context that survives its
   own application — so an insertion at the head or the tail of that context applied again, and
   again (`insertion-only-presses.txt`: three presses, three copies of the inserted line). Every
   hunk this patch ships removes nothing; they escaped only because each `+` block happens to
   land mid-context. For a hunk with no removals the post-image is now asked about first — of
   the hinted line, which took a third pass to get right (§12).

3. *A resume of a pre-lane install patched a source nobody rebuilds.* Every CMaNGOS state file
   on `m910q` records twelve stages and not `patch-sources` (`state-files-m910q.txt`), so the
   first press after this merge ran the new stage and nothing else: it patched the checkout,
   then said `The server is already built; skipping the compile.`, then finished with "installed
   and running" — a source tree carrying the fix, an image without it, vmaps still short their
   14.8%, and not a word about it (`pre-lane-resume.txt`). `_patch_sources` now refuses when the
   patch would change a file AND `build_would_be_skipped()` — the spine's name for
   `stage_build`'s own record-AND-images rule — says the compile is not going to happen. A
   refusal rather than an invalidation, because invalidating the recorded build and extraction
   turns a resume into an unasked-for multi-hour recompile that rewrites `data/` under a running
   server, while refusing changes nothing on disk and leaves Start, Stop and Repair working. The
   price, stated: the install button stops working for that folder until the user acts on the
   sentence. What that sentence SAID was wrong, and is §12.

## 12. The third pass (2026-09-05, same lane): the remedy, the line endings, and the hint

A second review read the round above and sent it back. Two of its findings are the two halves of
one habit — a fix that is right, wearing a sentence nobody followed — and both were re-derived
here before anything was changed.

**BLOCKER: the refusal's remedy dead-ended at the database.** Defect 3's sentence ended "use
“Stop and remove containers…” on the Server tab, delete {server_dir}, and install it again".
Followed verbatim, on `m910q` 2026-09-05, driving `CmangosInstaller.run()` twice around it
against a state file in the real `~/tbc-7.4c` shape: press 1 refused; removing the containers
kept the database volume (`docker.remove_staged()` passes no `-v`, and its own armed warning says
so); deleting the folder took `.db_password` with it, because that file lives inside it;
`composegen.install_id()` is a digest of the ABSOLUTE path, so the reinstall came back to the
same volume name (`ffb3ef7e` before and after the `rmtree`); and press 2 stopped at
`_db_password` — "*that database cannot be opened again: `docker volume rm …` deletes it, and
every character in it*". `_db_password`'s own docstring had refused to send anyone down that
road four days earlier, for exactly this reason.

**The remedy now names what this press would skip, and keeps everything else.** Stop and remove
the containers, `docker image rm <this install's image>`, delete
`<server_dir>/data/.yulon-extract.json` **and `<server_dir>/data/Buildings`**, install again.
Removing the image turns `build_would_be_skipped()` False so the compile runs; removing the
evidence file is what makes the fix visible, since `extract.run_plan()` skips a tool that has a
record and `run_mmaps()` reads its own record out of that same file, so deleting it re-runs the
extraction and the movement maps built from it. Measured by FOLLOWING THE SENTENCE: the test
parses the image reference and every path out of the message, does those things and nothing
else, and presses again — the compile runs, the four extraction tools and MoveMapGen run, the
checkout ends byte-identical to the patched fixture, the install finishes "installed and
running", `.db_password` is unchanged, `data/vmaps` is still there, the volume set is unchanged,
and the import stage says "They are already imported; leaving them alone." The control beside it
removes ONLY the image: the compile runs, and the maps are skipped with three `already
extracted` lines — which is why the sentence names the evidence file too.

**Why the third path is in the sentence, and what the round before got wrong.** The 2026-09-05
review of the paragraph above found the one claim nothing in the suite could see. That paragraph
said the deletion re-ran the extraction "with each `produces` folder emptied first", crediting
`empty_out_dirs()`. `empty_out_dirs()` has ONE call site in the package — `run_plan()`'s retry
pass, `extract.py:1030` — and its own docstring forbids the other one ("The retry path only,
never a first run"; a first run "leaves them exactly as it found them"). The ordinary loop calls
`make_out_dirs()`, which creates. So the press the sentence asked for re-ran `vmap_extractor`
over a `data/Buildings` the first extraction had filled, and that tool's `main()` refuses to
start when `Buildings/dir` or `Buildings/dir_bin` is there (read at both pinned revisions on
m910q 2026-09-05 — `mangos-classic 8ec338a1` `contrib/vmap_extractor/vmapextract/vmapexport.cpp`
:465-483 and `mangos-tbc f82e7d67` :515-533, quoted in `extract.DIRTY_MARKERS`). Driven through
the real `run_plan()`: `ad` finished, `vmap extract` exited 1 on "*Your output directory seems to
be polluted, please use an empty directory!*", the evidence file was re-created carrying `dbc and
maps` alone, and the press after that died identically — a wedge, since no message named a
folder and no retry recipe can reach an exit-1 (`wow-tbc` has none, `wow-vanilla`'s fires on
`Segmentation fault|core dumped`/139). The two real installs on that box were in exactly that
shape: `~/tbc-7.4c/data/Buildings` 7,171 files including a 50,938,121-byte `dir_bin`,
`~/vanilla-75b` 5,076 including 31,072,203.

Three folders are NOT named, and that is a reading rather than a hope: `ad` creates with
`CreateDir()` (`contrib/extractor/System.cpp:109-116` at 8ec338a1, `:98-105` at f82e7d67 — the
round that first wrote this paragraph gave TBC's line numbers for both) and overwrites what it
writes through `fopen(.., "wb")`; `vmap_assembler`'s `main()` has two `return 1`s and neither is
about the destination while `TileAssembler` opens every output `fopen(.., "wb")`
(`src/game/vmap/TileAssembler.cpp:111,162,338`, identical at both revisions — the
`110,158,329,338` first written here matches neither); and `contrib/mmap`'s `MoveMapGen` has no
such check either — a `git grep -i` for "polluted", "dirty" and "empty directory" over those three
trees at both revisions returns nothing. It does not OVERWRITE either, which this paragraph used
to say it did: `MapBuilder::shouldSkipTile` (`contrib/mmap/src/MapBuilder.cpp:1186` at 8ec338a1,
`:1204` at f82e7d67) reads an existing `.mmtile`'s header and skips that tile when the magic, the
Detour version and the mmap version all match, so it keeps matching tiles and rebuilds the rest.
Nothing downstream sees the difference, because the mmaps stage wipes `mmaps/` itself when no
finished record vouches for it — but "no refusal" and "overwrites" are separate claims and only
the first was read. `wow-tortoise` is excluded
for the opposite reason: its `vmap extract` produces `Buildings` too but runs
`/opt/tortoise/bin/vmapextractor`, whose `main()` goes from `processArgv` straight to `mkdir`
with no check at all — read at `Shyalya/tortoise-wow` **7c0fb278**, the rev `catalog.json` pins
(fetched `--depth 1` for the reading; the clone on the box stood at 7f2957e0), where a grep for
"polluted" and "empty directory" over that file counts 0. So the refusal is keyed on the BINARY
as well as the folder rather than claimed for a lineage nobody has watched refuse. Every read in
this paragraph is in `pyplan/gates/doodad-2026-09-05/extractor-dirty-output.txt`, which is the
output of the script beside it.

**The engine now says the folder's name instead of the tool saying nothing.** `run_plan()` asks
`blocking_output()` of every unsatisfied tool in one pass, before it makes any folder, starts any
container or rewrites the evidence file, and refuses with `data/Buildings` named and the fix
stated ("Delete … and press Install again"). It does not delete anything: `empty_out_dirs()` on a
first run is the obvious fix and the wrong one, because what is under `data/Buildings` is hours of
somebody's extraction and nobody asked for it to go.
Three further presses reach the same wall and now say the same thing, none of which anyone had
noticed: a `data/` whose evidence names ANOTHER CLIENT, one whose PLAN HASH changed, and a
press after a Stop taken while `vmap extract` was running (that one leaves `Buildings/dir_bin`
behind — the extractor appends it from the first tile, `adtfile.cpp:118` and `wdtfile.cpp:51` open
it `"ab"` — so the cancel note's "only the tool that was interrupted runs again" was true of the
records and not of the next press). Each has a test in `tests/test_extract.py` that follows the
refusal and finishes.

**The marker the guard is really about is `dir_bin`, and for one round the tests said otherwise.**
`vmapexport.cpp`'s check is an OR over `Buildings/dir` and `Buildings/dir_bin`, and the round that
wrote the guard read the CHECK without reading the WRITERS: six places then stated that the
extractor writes `dir` as it goes and `dir_bin` at the end. The sources say the inverse. Re-read on
yulon-fedora 2026-09-05 at both pinned revisions (`~/cmangos-probe9`, fetched `--depth 1` by SHA),
`git grep -nE '"/dir"' -- contrib` returns exactly one hit at each — `vmapexport.cpp:474` at
8ec338a1 and `:524` at f82e7d67, the stat check itself — while `dir_bin` is
`fopen(dirname.c_str(), "ab")` per ADT and per WDT, and `temp_gameobject_models` is written last,
by the `ExtractGameobjectModels()` call that ends `main()`. All three real installs on m910q hold
`dir_bin` and `temp_gameobject_models` and exactly zero files named `dir`
(`gates/doodad-2026-09-05/real-installs-m910q.txt`) — and two of the three were already listed
that way, with a `dir_bin` and no `dir`, in `extractor-dirty-output.txt` §5 lines 147-151, beneath
a paragraph claiming the opposite. Both test doubles were writing a `dir` no extraction produces,
so the half of the guard that fires in the world was asserted by nothing. The pair that measures
that, on the gate's suite (`mutations-round5.txt`): keying `blocking_output()` on `dir` alone —
the marker nothing writes — is 10 RED now, and 4 with both doubles put back to writing `dir`. The
six that go quiet under the fabrication are exactly the tests that drive the guard through
`run_plan()` over a `Buildings/` in the shape the world's are in. The doubles now write
`dir_bin` and `temp_gameobject_models` only, and `dir` stays in `DIRTY_MARKERS` for the one reason
that survives — the tool stats it, so a folder that holds one is refused by the real binary
whoever put it there.

That reason then had to be asserted too, and for one round it was not. The mirror of the mutation
above — narrowing `blocking_output()`'s OR to `if (folder / DIR_BIN).exists():`, dropping the half
`DIRTY_MARKERS` exists for — survived the whole gate set: 2758 passed, 4 skipped, 23 deselected,
0 RED (yulon-fedora 2026-09-05, `mutations-round6.txt` MU4, anchor asserted `== 1`, `__pycache__`
purged both sides, original restored and md5-checked). The test named for the marker asked
`blocking_output()` only for the `dir_bin` folder and, once `dir_bin` was unlinked, called
`blocked_message()` directly — which
lists whatever is present without ever asking whether the guard fires. One line closes it
(`assert extract.blocking_output(VMAP, data) == buildings` after the unlink), and the same
mutation is now RED. The condition being mirrored is `!stat(sdir.c_str(), &status) ||
!stat(sdir_bin.c_str(), &status)` — `vmapexport.cpp:477` at 8ec338a1 and `:527` at f82e7d67,
re-read at both revisions.

**The refusal now runs nothing before it refuses.** `blocking_output()` used to be asked per tool
inside `run_plan()`'s loop, and the shipped plans put `dbc and maps` first, so the press that
refused `vmap extract` had already run an `ad` container to completion — under a sentence reading
"Nothing was run and nothing was changed." Driven through `run_plan()` twice on yulon-fedora
2026-09-05, same scenario, only the guard's position changed: in the loop it launched `["ad"]` and
rewrote `data/.yulon-extract.json`, the file the remedy had just told the user to delete; hoisted
over the whole plan it launched `[]` and left `data/` byte-identical. On a real client that
difference is tens of minutes of `ad` and every file under `dbc/` and `maps/` written again, since
`ad` opens each output `"wb"`. The question is now asked over every unsatisfied tool in one pass
before the first container and before the evidence file is rewritten, and a test asserts the
sentence's words together with its truth.

**And the sentence says EXTRACTION, not press.** The hoist made "nothing was run" true of the
extraction and the round that made it then widened the words to the press, which is a different
and false claim: the stage spine runs `clone-sources`, `patch-sources`, `db-password`,
`write-dockerfile`, `generate-compose` and `build` before `extract`. Driven through the real
`CmangosInstaller.run()` on yulon-fedora 2026-09-05 in the state this lane's own remedy asks for —
images gone (`docker image rm`, so `images_built` answers False), `data/.yulon-extract.json`
deleted, `data/Buildings` kept — two fixtures both logged "compiling" and "The build finished."
exactly four log lines above the refusal: a pre-`patch-sources` install, which came out with 11
changed files under the server folder, and a finished modern one, which came out with 1
(`.yulon-install.json`). Neither launched an extraction container and neither changed a byte under
`data/`. So the shipped sentence is "The extraction ran nothing and changed nothing under data/.",
which is what was measured, and `cmangos.py`'s `_data_dir()` refusal — reached from the same two
stages, after the same build — says "This stage ran nothing and removed nothing." for the same
reason. Both are asserted by name in tests, and deleting either is red.

**What this costs, and the recommendation the owner asked for.** The owner said "do what you
recommend". The recommendation is the refusal as it now stands, and the argument is the price:
the first sentence cost a world (a reinstall into the same folder cannot open the old volume, and
the only way past it deletes every character), the second cost a recompile and then wedged the
install, and the one in the tree now costs a recompile plus an extraction — hours on the box, and
on disk only `data/Buildings`, which this app wrote and is about to write again. It is also
proportionate to where the refusal fires: stage 2 of 13, on a folder whose ONLY missing stage is
`patch-sources`. The alternative the round above rejected (invalidate the record and rebuild
automatically) is still rejected, and now for a second reason: the user pressing Install is not
asking for four hours of compiling, and the remedy is the same work done deliberately. What is
NOT offered is a way to keep the old maps and skip the patch: there is no override, and adding
one is a design question this lane did not open. Nor is there a "re-extract this tool" button:
the folder is deleted by the person who owns it, on a sentence that names it, and no press of
Install removes anything under `data/` that the retry pass did not put there.

**Two mutation counts in the round before this one, corrected.** The record for 7e1cf849 claimed
"the fixed-password branch never taken → 2 RED" and "an extraction record never licenses a skip →
2 RED", and neither number reproduces from the record because neither spelling was written down.
Re-run on m910q 2026-09-05 on this lane's tree, with the anchor's occurrence count asserted
`== 1`, every substitution md5-checked on disk and `__pycache__` purged on both sides. Taking
`_why_not_to_delete_the_folder`'s `generated` branch out of reach — the four lines from `plan =
self.entry.install.password` to the first `f"Do not delete …fresh start either"`, with
`if plan.mode != "generated" or plan.file is None:` replaced by `if True:`, which is unique where
that condition alone occurs TWICE (`cmangos.py` :536 and :670) — gives **1 RED**,
`test_the_refusal_says_why_the_install_folder_is_the_one_thing_not_to_delete` (md5
727ba72c…→9cb6da36…). The 2 in the old record came from a `str.replace()` on that twice-occurring
condition, which flipped the unrelated site as well and drew in
`test_the_family_s_catalog_refusals_end_in_one_tail_and_not_two`. Making `satisfied()` answer
False after the record check (`return not shortfall(produces, data_dir)` → `return False`, the
four-line tail anchored) gives **24 RED** across `test_extract.py` and `test_families_cmangos.py`
on this tree (md5 131d76f2…→147edccc…); the review measured 18 on 7e1cf849, and the six between
them are the tests this pass adds. The old record's 2 came from scoring it against
`tests/test_families_cmangos.py` alone. Both mutants die either way, so no test was weaker than
claimed — the numbers were.

**The upstream draft's patch is refused by `git apply` — as a CRLF file, on every tree.** The
second pass fixed the fence's CONTENT and asserted it through `read_text()`, which translates
line endings; so the assertion went on holding while this repository's Windows checkout held the
doc with CRLF endings, and the FENCE inside it came to 4,017 bytes against the shipped patch's
3,943 LF ones. (The 13,780/13,534 pair the first write-up of this quoted is the whole DOCUMENT
before and after the pin — two objects, not one, as the review of 2026-09-05 said; the pair that
is a mismatch is 4,017 against 3,943, which is what `fence-eol-apply-check.txt` and the test
docstring carry.) The fence extracted from that copy
exits 1 on all four trees measured — `mangos-classic 8ec338a1`, `mangos-tbc f82e7d67`, and each
clone's newest `origin/master` (`9b682be6`, `46d9a78d`) — with `error: patch failed:
contrib/vmap_extractor/vmapextract/gameobject_extract.cpp:24`, while the LF form exits 0 on all
four (`fence-eol-apply-check.txt`). The committed blob was always LF, so what GitHub serves has
always applied; the copy in front of the person who posts it had not. The doc is now pinned
`text eol=lf` in `.gitattributes` — the pin its neighbour `*.patch` has carried since the second
pass, for the same reason spelled out beside it — the equality is asserted on BYTES, and a second
test asserts both halves: that the pin is declared, and that the checkout it is reading actually
arrived without a CR in it. Recommendation: the draft is postable now; nothing in this lane posts
it.

**And the order fix of defect 2 had a defect of its own, found the same day.** It asked `_find` for
the post-image, and `_find` searches the whole file once the hint misses — so a post-image
occurring anywhere beat a pre-image sitting exactly at the line the patch named, and that site
was reported as "already carries the fix" and never touched (measured against
`git show HEAD:…patch.py` and the fixed module: `int a;/int b;/int c;/ZZZ/int a;/int b;/int c;/
int d;` → `(0, 1)` and unchanged, against `(1, 0)` and patched). It voided `_find`'s own written
guarantee for exactly the hunk class this patch is made of. The question is now asked AT THE
HINT, with the whole-file question kept one branch lower, after the hinted line has been ruled
out as an unpatched site — which is what keeps an already-applied insertion at an OFFSET from
doubling. That second branch survived its first mutation (`if False:` left the suite green),
because no shipped hunk and no fixture had the shape that needs it: four of the five are applied
AT their hint and the fifth inserts mid-context, which breaks its own pre-image up. It has a test
of its own now, and the mutation kills it.

**The report** is `pyplan/upstream-cmangos-doodad-issue.md`, not posted.

**Not done, said plainly.** No existing Linux install was retro-fitted (§10 cost 3), and after
defect 3 above an existing install is not quietly half-retro-fitted either: it is refused, with
a remedy in the sentence that keeps its database. No gate
re-ran a whole Vanilla or TBC install through the new stage on a VM — the stage was proved on
the pinned trees' bytes through the Python applier, and the extractor's behaviour was proved
on `m910q` with the same patch through `git apply`; the two were shown to produce identical
bytes (`test_patch.py`), which is the join. The first full install after this merge is where
the stage's `Patched …` lines and the extraction's counts line should be read.
